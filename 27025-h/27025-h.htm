5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>For some years before his death it was the intention of
Theodore Watts-Dunton to publish in volume form under the title
of &lsquo;Old Familiar Faces,&rsquo; the recollections of his
friends that he had from time to time contributed to <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; Had his range of interests been less
wide he might have found the time in which to further this and
many other literary projects he had formed; but he was,
unfortunately, very slow to write, and slower still to
publish.&nbsp; His long life produced in published works a number
of critical and biographical essays contributed to periodicals
and encyclop&aelig;dias, a romance (&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;), a
sheaf of poems (&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo;), two of the
most stimulating critical pronouncements that his century
produced (&lsquo;Poetry&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Renascence of
Wonder&rsquo;), a handful of introductions to classics&mdash;and
that is all.</p>
<p>Only those who were frequent visitors at &ldquo;The
Pines&rdquo; can form any idea of his keen interest in life and
affairs, which seemed to grow rather than to diminish with the
passage of each year, even when 81 had passed him by.&nbsp; At
his charmingly situated house at the foot of Putney Hill, he
lived a life of as little seclusion as he would have lived in
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Fleet Street.&nbsp; Here he received his friends and
acquaintances, and there was little happening in the world
outside with which he was unacquainted.</p>
<p>He was a tremendous worker, and only a few months before his
death he wrote of &ldquo;the enormous pressure of work&rdquo;
that was upon him, telling his correspondent that he had
&ldquo;no idea, no one can have any idea, what it is.&nbsp; I am
an early riser and breakfast at seven, and from that hour until
seven in the evening, I am in full swing of my labours with the
aid of two most intelligent secretaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To outlive his generation is, perhaps, the worst fate that can
befall a man; but this cannot truly be said of Theodore
Watts-Dunton, who seemed to be of no generation in
particular.&nbsp; His interest in the life of the twentieth
century, a life so different from that of his own youth and early
manhood, was strangely keen and insistent.&nbsp; Sometimes in
talking of his great contemporaries, Tennyson, Meredith,
Swinburne, Rossetti, Morris, Matthew Arnold, Borrow, there would
creep into his voice a note of reminiscent sadness; but it always
seemed poetic rather than personal.&nbsp; It may be said that he
never really grew up, that his spirit never tired.&nbsp; His
laugh was as youthful as the hearty &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo;
with which he would address his friends.</p>
<p>His most remarkable quality was his youth.&nbsp; <!-- page
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>His body
had aged, his voice had shrunk; but once launched into the
subject of literature, Greek verse in particular (he regarded the
Attic tongue as the peculiar vehicle for poetic expression), he
seemed immediately to become a young man.&nbsp; When quoting his
favourite passage from Keats, his voice would falter with
emotion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Charm&rsquo;d magic casements, opening on the
foam<br />
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines he regarded as the finest in English poetry.</p>
<p>He possessed the great gift of conversation.&nbsp; Every
subject seemed to develope quite naturally out of that which had
preceded it, and although in a single hour he would have passed
from &AElig;schylus and Sophocles to twentieth-century
publishers, there was never any break or suspicion of a change of
topic.&nbsp; Seated on the sofa in the middle of his study, with
reminders of his friendship with Rossetti gazing down upon him
from the walls, he welcomed his friends with that almost boyish
cordiality that so endeared him to their hearts.&nbsp; If they
had been doing anything of which the world knew, he would be sure
to have heard all about it.&nbsp; His mind was as alert as his
memory was remarkable; but above all he was possessed of a very
real charm, a charm that did not vanish before the on-coming
years.&nbsp; It was this quality of interesting himself in the
doings of <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>others that retained for him the
friendships that his personality and cordiality had created.</p>
<p>Few men have been so richly endowed with great friendships as
Theodore Watts-Dunton: Swinburne, the Rossettis, William Morris,
Matthew Arnold, Tennyson, Borrow, Lowell, Latham, men of vastly
dissimilar temperaments; yet he was on terms of intimacy with
them all, and as they one by one passed away, to him was left the
sad duty of giving to the world by far the most intimate picture
of their various personalities.&nbsp; There was obviously some
subtle quality in Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s nature that not only
attracted to him great minds in the world of art and letters; but
which seemed to hold captive their affection for a
lifetime.&nbsp; Even an instinctive recluse such as Borrow, a man
almost too sensitive for friendship, found in Watts-Dunton one
whose capacity for friendship was so great as to override all
other considerations.&nbsp; Watts-Dunton was &ldquo;the friend of
friends&rdquo; to Rossetti, who wished to make him his heir, and
was dissuaded only when he saw that to do so would pain his
friend, who regarded it as an act of injustice to
Rossetti&rsquo;s own family.&nbsp; During his lifetime Swinburne
desired to make over to him his entire fortune.&nbsp; The man to
whom these tributes were paid was undoubtedly possessed of some
rare and strange gift.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The greatest among his many great friendships <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was with
Swinburne.&nbsp; For thirty years they lived together at
&ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; in the closest unity and accord.&nbsp;
They would take their walks together, discuss the hundred and one
things in which they were both interested, living, not as great
men sometimes live, a frigid existence of intellectual
loneliness; but showing the keenest interest in the affairs of
the everyday, as well as of the literary, world.&nbsp; When death
at last severed the link that it had taken upwards of thirty
years to forge, it is not strange that there should be no
reminiscences written of the man who had been to Watts-Dunton
more than a brother.</p>
<p>It was not always easy to get Watts-Dunton to talk of those he
had known so intimately; but when he did so it was frankly and
freely.&nbsp; Once when telling of some characteristic act of
generosity on the part of that strangely composite being, half
genius, half schoolboy, William Morris, he remarked, &ldquo;Yes,
Morris was a very dear friend of mine; but he had strange
limitations.&nbsp; Swinburne had the utmost contempt for the
narrowness of his outlook.&nbsp; It was incredible!&nbsp; Outside
his own domain he was unintelligent in his narrowness, and
frequently bored and irritated his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As artist, poet, and craftsman, however, Watts-Dunton spoke
with enthusiasm of Morris; <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>but
intellectually he regarded him as inferior to Mrs. Morris.&nbsp;
On the day following the announcement of her death, the present
writer happened to be taking tea at &ldquo;The Pines,&rdquo; and
the conversation not unnaturally turned upon the Morrises.&nbsp;
Watts-Dunton called attention to the large number of magnificent
Rossetti portraits of her that hung from the walls of his
study.&nbsp; &ldquo;A remarkable woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
most remarkable woman; superior to Morris intellectually, she
reached a greater mental height than he was capable of, yet few
knew it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he proceeded to tell how she had
acquired French and Italian with the greatest ease and
facility.&nbsp; When Morris had met her she possessed very few
educational advantages; yet she very quickly made good her
shortcomings.&nbsp; When reminded that Mr. H. Buxton Forman had
recently written that he had seen beautiful women in all quarters
of the globe, &ldquo;but never one so strangely lovely and
majestic as Mrs. Morris,&rdquo; Watts-Dunton remarked, &ldquo;She
was the most lovely woman I have ever known, her beauty was
incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to a question he went on to say that Rossetti
painted her lips with the utmost faithfulness.&nbsp; In spite of
her beauty and her high mental qualities, she was very shy and
retiring, almost fearful, in her attitude towards others.</p>
<p>In literature and criticism Watts-Dunton <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>stood for
enthusiasm.&nbsp; His gospel as a critic was to seek for the good
that is to be found in most things, literary or otherwise; and
what is, perhaps, most remarkable in one who has known so many
great men, he never seemed to draw invidious comparisons between
the writers and artists of to-day and those of the great
Victorian Era.</p>
<p>Life at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; was as bright as naturally
cheerful and bright people could make it, people who were not
only attracted to and interested in each other; but found the
world an exceedingly good place in which to live.&nbsp; The home
circle was composed of Swinburne, Watts-Dunton, his two sisters,
Miss Watts and Mrs. Mason.&nbsp; To these must be added Mr.
Thomas Hake, for many years Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s friend and
secretary, who was in daily attendance.&nbsp; Later the circle
was enlarged by the entry into it of the young and accomplished
bride, the present Mrs. Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; would have seemed a strange place
without &ldquo;the Colonel,&rdquo; as Watts-Dunton always called
Mr. Hake, adopting a family name given to him when a boy on
account of his likeness to his cousin, General, then Colonel,
Gordon.&nbsp; Nothing amused Watts-Dunton more than for some
caller to start discussing army matters with the supposed
ex-officer.&nbsp; He would watch with a mischievous glee Mr.
Hake&rsquo;s endeavours to carry on a conversation <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>in
which he had no special interest.&nbsp; Watts-Dunton never
informed callers of their mistake, and to this day there is one
friend of twenty-five years&rsquo; standing, a man keenly
interested in National Defence, who regards Mr. Hake as an
authority upon army matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No living man knew Borrow so well as Thomas
Hake,&rdquo; Watts-Dunton once remarked to a friend.&nbsp; To the
young Hakes Lavengro was a great joy, and they would often
accompany him part of his way home from Coombe End.&nbsp; On one
occasion Borrow said to the youngest boy, &ldquo;Do you know how
to fight a man bigger than yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp; The lad
confessed that he did not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Borrow,
&ldquo;You challenge him to fight, and when he is taking off his
coat, you hit him in the stomach as hard as you can and run for
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinburne and Watts-Dunton had first met in 1872.&nbsp; In
1879 they went to live together at &ldquo;The Pines,&rdquo; and
from that date were never parted until Swinburne&rsquo;s death
thirty years&rsquo; later.&nbsp; In no literary friendship has
the bond been closer.&nbsp; Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s first act each
morning was to visit Swinburne in his own room, where the poet
breakfasted alone with the morning newspapers.&nbsp; During the
morning the two would take their daily walk together, a practice
continued for many years.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no time like the
morning for a walk,&rdquo; Swinburne would say, &ldquo;The
sparkle, the exhilaration <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of it.&nbsp;
I walk every morning of my life, no matter what the weather,
pelting along all the time as fast as I can go.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
perfect health he attributed entirely to this habit.</p>
<p>In later years he would take his walks alone.&nbsp; It was
during one of these that he met with an adventure that seemed to
cause him some irritation.&nbsp; A young artist hearing that
&ldquo;the master&rdquo; walked each day up Putney Hill lay in
wait for him.&nbsp; After several unsuccessful ventures he at
length saw a figure approaching which he instantly
recognized.&nbsp; Crossing the road the youth went boldly up and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are Mr. Swinburne, may I shake hands with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; remarked the astonished poet.</p>
<p>The young man repeated his request in a louder voice,
remembering Swinburne&rsquo;s deafness, adding:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my ambition to shake hands with you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; was the response, as Swinburne
half-heartedly extended his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accustomed
to this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meal times at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; were occasions when
there was much talk and laughter; for in both Swinburne and
Watts-Dunton the mischievous spirit of boyhood had not been
entirely disciplined by life, and in the other members of the
household the same unconquerable spirit of youth was
manifest.&nbsp; <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Sometimes there were great
discussions and arguments.&nbsp; Watts-Dunton had more than a
passing interest in science, whereas, to Swinburne it was
anathema, although his father was strongly scientific in his
learning.&nbsp; The libraries of the two men clearly showed how
different were their tastes; for that of Watts-Dunton was
all-embracing, Swinburne&rsquo;s was as exclusive as his circle
of personal friends.&nbsp; The one was the library of a critic,
the other that of a poet.</p>
<p>Swinburne enjoyed nothing better than a discussion, and he was
a foe who wielded a stout blade.&nbsp; He fought, however, with
scrupulous fairness, never interrupting an adversary; but
listening to him with a deliberate patience that was almost
disconcerting.&nbsp; Then when his turn came he would overwhelm
his opponent and destroy his most weighty arguments in what a
friend once described as &ldquo;a lava torrent of burning
words.&rdquo;&nbsp; He possessed many of the qualities necessary
to debate: concentration, the power of pouncing upon the weak
spot in his adversary&rsquo;s argument, and above all a wonderful
memory.&nbsp; What he lacked was that calm and calculating
frigidity so necessary to the successful debater.&nbsp; Instead
of freezing his opponent to silence with deliberate logic, he
would strive rather by the tempestuous quality of his rhetoric to
hurl him into the next parish.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>There were times when he would work himself up into a
passion of denunciation, when, trembling and quivering in every
limb, he would in a fine frenzy of scorn annihilate those whom he
conceived to be his enemies, and in scathing periods pour
ridicule upon their works.&nbsp; But if he were merciless in his
onslaughts upon his foes, he was correspondingly loyal in the
defence of his friends.&nbsp; He seemed as incapable of seeing
the weakness of a friend as of appreciating the strength of an
enemy.</p>
<p>The things and the people who did not interest him he had the
fortunate capacity of entirely forgetting.&nbsp; A friend <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> tells of how on one occasion he
happened to mention in the course of conversation a book by a
certain author whom he knew had been a visitor at &ldquo;The
Pines&rdquo; on several occasions, and as such was personally
known to Swinburne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! really,&rdquo; Swinburne remarked, &ldquo;Yes, now
that you mention it, I believe someone of that name has been so
good as to come and see us.&nbsp; I seem to recall him, and I
seem to remember hearing someone say that he had written
something, though I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what.&nbsp; So
he has published a book upon the subject of which we are
talking.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I did not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was said with perfect courtesy and <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>without the
least intention of administering a snub or belittling the writer
in question.&nbsp; Swinburne had merely forgotten because there
was nothing in that author&rsquo;s personality that had impressed
itself upon him.&nbsp; On the other hand, he would remember the
minutest details of conversations in which he had been
interested.</p>
<p>In spite of his capacity for passionate outbursts and inspired
invective, Swinburne was a most attentive listener, provided
there were things being said to which it was worth
listening.&nbsp; At meal times when his attention became engaged
he would forget everything but the conversation.&nbsp;
Indifferent as to what stage of the meal he was at, he would turn
to whoever it might be that had introduced the subject, and would
talk or listen oblivious of the fact that food might be
spoiling.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was a small eater.</p>
<p>On one occasion when lunching at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; Mr.
Coulson Kernahan happened to remark that he had in his pocket a
copy of Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s then unpublished poem,
&lsquo;The Death of a First-born,&rsquo; written in memory of the
Duke of Clarence.&nbsp; Down went knife and fork as Swinburne
half rose from his chair to reach across the table for the
manuscript.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is as a god to mortals when compared
to most other living women poets,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
Then, in his thin-high-pitched, but exquisitely <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>modulated
voice he half read, half chanted, two stanzas of the poem.</p>
<blockquote><p>One young life lost, two happy young lives
blighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With earthward eyes we see:<br />
With eyes uplifted, keener, farther sighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We look, O Lord to thee.</p>
<p>Grief hears a funeral knell: hope hears the ringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of birthday bells on high.<br />
Faith, Hope and Love make answer with soft singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half carol and half cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He stopped abruptly refusing to read the third and last stanza
because it was unequal, and the poem was stronger and finer by
its omission.&nbsp; Then he said in a hushed voice, &ldquo;For
the happy folk who are able to think as she thinks, who believe
as she believes, the poem is of its kind perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With glowing eyes and with hand that marked time to the music,
he read once more the second verse, repeating the line,
&ldquo;half carol and half cry&rdquo; three times, lowering his
voice with each repetition until it became little more than a
whisper.&nbsp; Laying the manuscript reverently beside him, he
sat perfectly still for a space with brooding eyes, then rising
silently left the room with short swift strides. <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>Many of Swinburne&rsquo;s friends have testified to his
personal charm and courtliness of bearing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unmistakably an aristocrat, and with <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>all the ease
and polish which one associates with high breeding, there was,
even in the cordiality with which he would rise and come forward
to welcome a visitor a suspicion of the shy nervousness of the
introspective man and of the recluse on first facing a
stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Coulson Kernahan has said, &ldquo;I
have seen him angry, I have heard him furiously dissent from, and
even denounce the views put forward by others, but never once was
what, for want of a better word, I must call his personal
deference to those others relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To no one would he defer quite so graciously and
readily, to no one was he so scrupulously courtly in bearing as
to those who constituted his own household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he felt that he had monopolized the conversation he would
turn to Watts-Dunton and apologize, and for a time become
transformed into an attentive listener.</p>
<p>Lord Ronald Gower writes of Swinburne&rsquo;s remarkable
powers as a talker.&nbsp; Telling of a luncheon at &ldquo;The
Pines&rdquo; in 1879, he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Swinburne&rsquo;s
talk after luncheon was wonderful . . . What, far beyond the
wonderful flow of words of the poet, struck me, was his real
diffidence and modesty; while fully aware of the divine gifts
within him, he is as simple and unaffected as a child.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p18b.jpg">
<img alt="Theodore Watts-Dunton" src="images/p18s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But conversation at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; was not <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>always of the serious things of life.&nbsp; It very
frequently partook of the playful, when the hearers would be kept
amused with a humour and whimsicality, cauterized now and then
with some biting touch of satire which showed that neither
Swinburne nor Watts-Dunton had entirely grown up.</p>
<p>Reading aloud was also a greatly favoured form of
entertainment.&nbsp; Swinburne was a sympathetic reader,
possessed of a voice of remarkable quality and power of
expression, and he would read for the hour together from Dickens,
Lamb, Charles Reade, and Thackeray.&nbsp; To Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s
little boy he was a wizard who could open many magic
casements.&nbsp; He would carry off the lad to his own room, and
there read to him the stories which caused the hour of bedtime to
be dreaded.&nbsp; When the nurse arrived to fetch the child to
bed he would imperiously wave her away, hoping that Swinburne
would not notice the action and so bring the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment to a close.&nbsp; On one occasion the child stole
down to Swinburne&rsquo;s room after he had been safely put to
bed, where the interrupted story was renewed.&nbsp; When
eventually discovered both seemed to regard the incident as a
huge joke, and Swinburne carried the child to the nursery and
tucked him up for the night.</p>
<p>A great capacity for friendship involves an equally great meed
of sorrow.&nbsp; At last the <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>hour arrived
when the friend who was nearer to him than a brother followed
those who one by one he had mourned, and of the old familiar
faces there were left to him only the two sisters, whose love and
devotion had contributed so much to his domestic happiness, and
his friend, Mr. Thomas Hake, who for seventeen years had acted as
confidential secretary.</p>

25</span>I.&nbsp; GEORGE BORROW.<br />
1803&ndash;1881.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>I have been reading those charming reminiscences of George
Borrow which appeared in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>. <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; I have been reading them, I may
add, under the happiest conditions for enjoying them&mdash;amid
the self-same heather and bracken where I have so often listened
to Lavengro&rsquo;s quaint talk of all the wondrous things he saw
and heard in his wondrous life.&nbsp; So graphically has Mr. Hake
depicted him, that as I walked and read his paper I seemed to
hear the fine East-Anglian accent of the well-remembered
voice&mdash;I seemed to see the mighty figure, strengthened by
the years rather than stricken by them, striding along between
the whin bushes or through the quags, now stooping over the water
to pluck the wild mint he loved, whose lilac-coloured blossoms
perfumed the air as he crushed them, now stopping to watch the
water-wagtail by the ponds as he descanted upon the powers of
that enchanted bird&mdash;powers, like many human endowments,
more glorious than pleasant, if it is sober truth, as Borrow
would gravely tell, that the gipsy lad who knocks a water-wagtail
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>on the head with a stone gains for a bride a
&ldquo;ladye from a far countrie,&rdquo; and dazzles with his
good luck all the other black-eyed young urchins of the
dingle.</p>
<p>Though my own intimacy with Borrow did not begin till he was
considerably advanced in years, and ended on his finally quitting
London for Oulton, there were circumstances in our
intercourse&mdash;circumstances, I mean, connected partly with
temperament and partly with mutual experience&mdash;which make me
doubt whether any one understood him better than I did, or broke
more thoroughly through that exclusiveness of temper which
isolated him from all but a few.&nbsp; However, be this as it
may, no one at least realized more fully than I how lovable was
his nature, with all his angularities&mdash;how simple and
courageous, how manly and noble.&nbsp; His shyness, his apparent
coldness, his crotchety obstinacy, repelled people, and
consequently those who at any time during his life really
understood him must have been very few.&nbsp; How was it, then,
that such a man wandered about over Europe and fraternized so
completely with a race so suspicious and intractable as the
gipsies?&nbsp; A natural enough question, which I have often been
asked, and this is my reply:&mdash;</p>
<p>Those who know the gipsies will understand me when I say that
this suspicious and wary race of wanderers&mdash;suspicious and
wary from <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>an instinct transmitted through ages
of dire persecutions from the Children of the Roof&mdash;will
readily fraternize with a blunt, single-minded, and shy eccentric
like Borrow, while perhaps the skilful man of the world may find
all his tact and <i>savoir faire</i> useless and, indeed, in the
way.&nbsp; And the reason of this is not far to seek,
perhaps.&nbsp; What a gipsy most dislikes is the feeling that his
&ldquo;gorgio&rdquo; interlocutor is thinking about him; for,
alas! to be the object of &ldquo;gorgio&rdquo; thoughts&mdash;has
it not been a most dangerous and mischievous honour to every
gipsy since first his mysterious race was driven to accept the
grudging hospitality of the Western world?&nbsp; A gipsy hates to
be watched, and knows at once when he is being watched; for in
tremulous delicacy of apprehension his organization is far beyond
that of an Englishman, or, indeed, of any member of any of the
thick-fingered races of Europe.&nbsp; One of the results of this
excessive delicacy is that a gipsy can always tell to a surety
whether a &ldquo;gorgio&rdquo; companion is thinking about him,
or whether the &ldquo;gorgio&rsquo;s&rdquo; thoughts are really
and genuinely occupied with the fishing rod, the net, the gin,
the gun, or whatsoever may be the common source of interest that
has drawn them together.</p>
<p>Now, George Borrow, after the first one or two awkward
interviews were well over, would lapse into a kind of unconscious
ruminating <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>bluntness, a pronounced and angular
self-dependence, which might well disarm the suspiciousness of
the most wary gipsy, from the simple fact that it was
genuine.&nbsp; Hence, as I say, among the few who understood
Borrow his gipsy friends very likely stood first&mdash;outside,
of course, his family circle.&nbsp; And surely this is an honour
to Borrow; for the gipsies, notwithstanding certain undeniable
obliquities in matters of morals and cusine, are the only people
left in the island who are still free from British vulgarity
(perhaps because they are not British).&nbsp; It is no less an
honour to them, for while he lived the island did not contain a
nobler English gentleman than him they called the &ldquo;Romany
Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s descriptions of gipsy life are, no doubt, too
deeply charged with the rich lights shed from his own personality
entirely to satisfy a more matter-of-fact observer, and I am not
going to say that he is anything like so photographic as F. H.
Groome, for instance, or so trustworthy.&nbsp; But then it should
never be forgotten that Borrow was, before everything else, a
poet.&nbsp; If this statement should be challenged by &ldquo;the
present time,&rdquo; let me tell the present time that by poet I
do not mean merely a man who is skilled in writing lyrics and
sonnets and that kind of thing, but primarily a man who has the
poetic gift of seeing through &ldquo;the shows of things&rdquo;
and knowing <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>where he is&mdash;the gift of
drinking deeply of the waters of life and of feeling grateful to
Nature for so sweet a draught; a man who, while acutely feeling
the ineffable pathos of human life, can also feel how sweet a
thing it is to live, having so great and rich a queen as Nature
for his mother, and for companions any number of such amusing
creatures as men and women.&nbsp; In this sense I cannot but set
Borrow, with his love of nature and his love of adventure, very
high among poets&mdash;as high, perhaps, as I place another
dweller in tents, Sylvester Boswell himself, &ldquo;the
well-known and popalated gipsy of Codling Gap,&rdquo; who, like
Borrow, is famous for &ldquo;his great knowledge in grammaring
one of the ancientist langeges on record,&rdquo; and whose
touching preference of a gipsy tent to a roof, &ldquo;on the
accent of health, sweetness of the air, and for enjoying the
pleasure of Nature&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; is expressed with a
poetical feeling such as Chaucer might have known had he not, as
a court poet, been too genteel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enjoying the
pleasure of Nature&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;&nbsp; That is what Borrow
did; and how few there are that understand it.</p>
<p>The self-consciousness which in the presence of man produces
that kind of shyness which was Borrow&rsquo;s characteristic left
him at once when he was with Nature alone or in the company of an
intimate friend.&nbsp; At her, no man&rsquo;s gaze was more frank
and childlike than his.&nbsp; Hence <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the charm of
his books.&nbsp; No man&rsquo;s writing can take you into the
country as Borrow&rsquo;s can: it makes you feel the sunshine,
see the meadows, smell the flowers, hear the skylark sing and the
grasshopper chirrup.&nbsp; Who else can do it?&nbsp; I know of
none.&nbsp; And as to personal intercourse with him, if I were
asked what was the chief delight of this, I should say that it
was the delight of bracingness.&nbsp; A walking tour with a
self-conscious lover of the picturesque&mdash;an
&ldquo;interviewer&rdquo; of Nature with a
note-book&mdash;worrying you to admire <i>him</i> for admiring
Nature so much, is one of those occasional calamities of life
which a gentleman and a Christian must sometimes heroically bear,
but the very thought of which will paralyze with fear the
sturdiest Nature-worshipper, whom no crevasse or avalanche or
treacherous mist can appal.&nbsp; But a walk and talk with Borrow
as he strode through the bracken on an autumn morning had the
exhilarating effect upon his companion of a draught of the
brightest mountain air.&nbsp; And this was the result not,
assuredly, of any exuberance of animal spirits (Borrow, indeed,
was subject to fits of serious depression), but rather of a
feeling he induced that between himself and all nature, from the
clouds floating lazily over head to the scented heather, crisp
and purple, under foot, there was an entire fitness and
harmony&mdash;a sort of mutual understanding, indeed.&nbsp; There
was, I say, something <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>bracing in the very look of this
silvery-haired giant as he strode along with a kind of easy
sloping movement, like that of a St. Bernard dog (the most
deceptive of all movements as regards pace), his beardless face
(quite matchless for symmetrical beauty) beaded with the healthy
perspiration drops of strong exercise, and glowing and rosy in
the sun.</p>
<p>As a vigorous old man Borrow never had an equal, I
think.&nbsp; There has been much talk of the vigour of
Shelley&rsquo;s friend, E. J. Trelawny.&nbsp; I knew that
splendid old corsair, and admired his agility of limb and brain;
but at seventy Borrow could have walked off with Trelawny under
his arm.&nbsp; At seventy years of age, after breakfasting at
eight o&rsquo;clock in Hereford Square, he would walk to Putney,
meet one or more of us at Roehampton, roam about Wimbledon and
Richmond Park with us, bathe in the Fen Ponds with a north-east
wind cutting across the icy water like a razor, run about the
grass afterwards like a boy to shake off some of the water-drops,
stride about the park for hours, and then, after fasting for
twelve hours, eat a dinner at Roehampton that would have done Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s eyes good to see.&nbsp; Finally, he would
walk back to Hereford Square, getting home late at night.</p>
<p>And if the physique of the man was bracing, his conversation,
unless he happened to be suffering from one of his occasional
fits of depression, <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>was still more so.&nbsp; Its
freshness, raciness, and eccentric whim no pen could
describe.&nbsp; There is a kind of humour the delight of which is
that while you smile at the pictures it draws, you smile quite as
much or more to think that there is a mind so whimsical,
crotchety, and odd as to draw them.&nbsp; This was the humour of
Borrow.&nbsp; His command of facial expression&mdash;though he
seemed to exercise it almost involuntarily and
unconsciously&mdash;had, no doubt, much to do with this
charm.&nbsp; Once, when he was talking to me about the men of
Charles Lamb&rsquo;s day&mdash;<i>The London Magazine</i>
set&mdash;I asked him what kind of a man was the notorious and
infamous Griffiths Wainewright. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; In a moment
Borrow&rsquo;s face changed: his mouth broke into a Carker-like
smile, his eyes became elongated to an expression that was at
once fawning and sinister, as he said, &ldquo;Wainewright!&nbsp;
He used to sit in an armchair close to the fire and <i>smile</i>
all the evening like <i>this</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made me see
Wainewright and hear his voice as plainly as though I had seen
him and heard him in the publishers&rsquo; parlour.</p>
<p>His vocabulary, rich in picturesque words of the high road and
dingle, his quaint countrified phrases, might also have added to
the <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>effect of this kind of eccentric humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
duncie book&mdash;of course it&rsquo;s duncie&mdash;it&rsquo;s
only duncie books that sell nowadays,&rdquo; he would shout when
some new &ldquo;immortal poem&rdquo; or &ldquo;greatest work of
the age&rdquo; was mentioned.&nbsp; Tennyson, I fear, was the
representative duncie poet of the time; but that was because
nothing could ever make Borrow realize the fact that Tennyson was
not the latest juvenile representative of a &ldquo;duncie&rdquo;
age; for although, according to Leland, <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> the author of &lsquo;Sordello&rsquo; is
(as is natural, perhaps) the only bard known in the gipsy tent,
it is doubtful whether even his name was more than a name to
Borrow; indeed, I think that people who had no knowledge of
Romany, Welsh, and Armenian were all more or less
&ldquo;duncie.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a trap to catch the &ldquo;foaming
vipers,&rdquo; his critics, he in &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo;
purposely misspelt certain Armenian and Welsh words, just to have
the triumph of saying in another volume that they who had
attacked him on so many points had failed to discover that he had
wrongly given &ldquo;zhats&rdquo; as the nominative of the
Armenian noun for bread, while everybody in England, especially
every critic, ought to know that &ldquo;zhats&rdquo; is the
accusative form.</p>
<p>I will try, however, to give the reader an <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>idea of the
whim of Borrow&rsquo;s conversation, by giving it in something
like a dramatic form.&nbsp; Let the reader suppose himself on a
summer&rsquo;s evening at that delightful old roadside inn the
Bald-Faced Stag, in the Roehampton Valley, near Richmond Park,
where are sitting, over a &ldquo;cup&rdquo; (to use
Borrow&rsquo;s word) of foaming ale, Lavengro himself, one of his
oldest friends, and a new acquaintance, a certain student of
things in general lately introduced to Borrow and nearly, but not
quite, admitted behind the hedge of Borrow&rsquo;s shyness, as
may be seen by the initiated from a certain rather constrained,
half-resentful expression on his face.&nbsp; Jerry
Abershaw&rsquo;s <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a> sword (the chief trophy of mine host)
has been introduced, and Borrow&rsquo;s old friend has been
craftily endeavouring to turn the conversation upon that ever
fresh and fruitful topic, but in vain.&nbsp; Suddenly the song of
a nightingale, perched on a tree not far off, rings pleasantly
through the open window and fills the room with a new atmosphere
of poetry and romance.&nbsp; &ldquo;That nightingale has as fine
a voice,&rdquo; says Borrow, &ldquo;as though he were born and
bred in the Eastern Counties.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow is proud of
being <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>an East-Anglian, of which the student
has already been made aware and which he now turns to good
account in the important business he has set himself, of melting
Lavengro&rsquo;s frost and being admitted a member of the
Open-Air Club.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the wily-student,
&ldquo;I know the Eastern Counties; no nightingales like those,
especially Norfolk nightingales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s face
begins to brighten slightly, but still he does not direct his
attention to the stranger, who proceeds to remark that although
the southern counties are so much warmer than Norfolk, some of
them, such as Cornwall and Devon, are without nightingales.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s face begins to get brighter still, and he looks
out of the window with a smile, as though he were being suddenly
carried back to the green lanes of his beloved Norfolk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From which well-known fact of ornithology,&rdquo;
continues the student, &ldquo;I am driven to infer that in their
choice of habitat nightingales are guided not so much by
considerations of latitude as of good taste.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s anger is evidently melting away.&nbsp; The talk
runs still upon nightingales, and the student mentions the
attempt to settle them in Scotland once made by Sir John
Sinclair, who introduced nightingales&rsquo; eggs from England
into robins&rsquo; nests in Scotland, in the hope that the young
nightingales, after enjoying a Scotch summer, would return to the
place of their birth, after <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the custom of
English nightingales.&nbsp; &ldquo;And did they return?&rdquo;
says Borrow, with as much interest as if the honour of his
country were involved in the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Return to
Scotland?&rdquo; says the student quietly; &ldquo;the entire
animal kingdom are agreed, you know, in never returning to
Scotland.&nbsp; Besides, the nightingales&rsquo; eggs in question
were laid in Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conquered at last, Borrow
extends the hand of brotherhood to the impudent student (whose
own private opinion, no doubt, is that Norfolk is more successful
in producing Nelsons than nightingales), and proceeds without
more ado to tell how &ldquo;poor Jerry Abershaw,&rdquo; on being
captured by the Bow Street runners, had left his good sword
behind him as a memento of highway glories soon to be ended on
the gallows tree.&nbsp; (By-the-bye, I wonder where that sword is
now; it was bought by Mr. Adolphus Levy, of Alton Lodge, at the
closing of the Bald-Faced Stag.)</p>
<p>From Jerry Abershaw Borrow gets upon other equally interesting
topics, such as the decadence of beer and pugilism, and the
nobility of the now neglected British bruiser, as exampled
especially in the case of the noble Pearce, who lost his life
through rushing up a staircase and rescuing a woman from a
burning house after having on a previous occasion rescued another
woman by blacking the eyes of six gamekeepers, who had been set
upon her by some noble lord <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>or
another.&nbsp; Then, while the ale sparkles with a richer colour
as the evening lights grow deeper, the talk gets naturally upon
&ldquo;lords&rdquo; in general, gentility nonsense, and
&ldquo;hoity-toityism&rdquo; as the canker at the heart of modern
civilization.</p>
<h3><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>II.</h3>
<p>Borrow could look at Nature without thinking of
himself&mdash;a rare gift, for Nature, as I have said, has been
disappointed in man.&nbsp; Her great desire from the first has
been to grow an organism so conscious that it can turn round and
look at her with intelligent eyes.&nbsp; She has done so at last,
but the consciousness is so high as to be self-conscious, and man
cannot for egotism look at his mother after all.&nbsp; Borrow was
a great exception.&nbsp; Thoreau&rsquo;s self-consciousness
showed itself in presence of Nature, Borrow&rsquo;s in presence
of man.&nbsp; The very basis of Borrow&rsquo;s nature was
reverence.&nbsp; His unswerving belief in the beneficence of God
was most beautiful, most touching.&nbsp; In his life Borrow had
suffered much: a temperament such as his must needs suffer
much&mdash;so shy it was, so proud, and yet yearning for a close
sympathy such as no creature and only solitary communing with
Nature can give.&nbsp; Under any circumstances, I say, Borrow
would have known how sharp and cruel are the flints along the
road&mdash;how tender are a poet&rsquo;s feet; but <i>his</i>
road at one time was rough indeed; not when he was with his gipsy
friends (for a tent is freer than a roof, according to the
grammarian of Codling Gap, and roast hedgehog is the daintiest of
viands), but when he was toiling in London, his fine gifts
unrecognized <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and useless&mdash;<i>that</i> was
when Borrow passed through the fire.&nbsp; Yet every sorrow and
every disaster of his life he traced to the kindly hand of a
benevolent and wise Father, who sometimes will use a whip of
scorpions, but only to chastise into a right and happy course the
children he loves.</p>
<p>Apart from the instinctive rectitude of his nature, it was
with Borrow a deep-rooted conviction that sin never goes, and
never can go, unpunished.&nbsp; His doctrine, indeed, was
something like the Buddhist doctrine of Karma&mdash;it was based
on an instinctive apprehension of the sacredness of
&ldquo;law&rdquo; in the most universal acceptation of that
word.&nbsp; Sylvester Boswell&rsquo;s definition of a free man,
in that fine, self-respective certificate of his, as one who is
&ldquo;free from all cares or fears of law that may come against
him,&rdquo; is, indeed, the gospel of every true
nature-worshipper.&nbsp; The moment Thoreau spurned the legal
tax-gatherer the law locked the nature-worshipper in gaol.&nbsp;
To enjoy nature the soul <i>must</i> be free&mdash;free not only
from tax-gatherers, but from sin; for every wrongful act awakes,
out of the mysterious bosom of Nature herself, its own peculiar
serpent, having its own peculiar stare, but always hungry and
bloody-fanged, which follows the delinquent&rsquo;s feet
whithersoever they go, gliding through the dewy grass on the
brightest morning, dodging round the trees on the calmest eve,
wriggling <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>across the brook where the wrongdoer
would fain linger on the stepping-stones to soothe his soul with
the sight of the happy minnows shooting between the
water-weeds&mdash;following him everywhere, in short, till at
last, in sheer desperation, he must needs stop and turn, and bare
his breast to the fangs; when, having yielded up to the thing its
fill of atoning blood, Nature breaks into her old smile again,
and he goes on his way in peace.</p>
<p>All this Borrow understood better than any man I have ever
met.&nbsp; Yet even into his doctrine of Providence Borrow
imported such an element of whim that it was impossible to listen
to him sometimes without a smile.&nbsp; For instance, having
arrived at the conclusion that a certain lieutenant had been
cruelly ill used by genteel magnates high in office, Borrow
discovered that since that iniquity Providence had frowned on the
British arms, and went on to trace the disastrous blunder of
Balaklava to this cause.&nbsp; Again, having decided that Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s worship of gentility and Jacobitism had been
the main cause of the revival of flunkeyism and Popery in
England, Borrow saw in the dreadful monetary disasters which
overclouded Scott&rsquo;s last days the hand of God, whose plan
was to deprive him of the worldly position Scott worshipped at
the very moment when his literary fame (which he misprized) was
dazzling the world.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>And now as to the gipsy wanderings.&nbsp; As I have
said, no man has been more entirely misunderstood than
Borrow.&nbsp; That a man who certainly did (as F. H. Groome says)
look like a &ldquo;colossal clergyman&rdquo; should have joined
the gipsies, that he should have wandered over England and
Europe, content often to have the grass for his bed and the sky
for his hostry-roof, has astonished very much (and I believe
scandalized very much) this age.&nbsp; My explanation of the
matter is this: Among the myriads of children born into a world
of brick and mortar there appears now and then one who is meant
for better things&mdash;one who exhibits unmistakable signs that
he inherits the blood of those remote children of the open air
who, according to the old Sab&aelig;an notion, on the plains of
Asia lived with Nature, loved Nature and were loved by her, and
from whom all men are descended.&nbsp; George Borrow was one of
those who show the olden strain.&nbsp; Now, for such a man, born
in a country like England, where the modern fanaticism of
house-worship has reached a condition which can only be called
maniacal, what is there left but to try for a time the
gipsy&rsquo;s tent?&nbsp; On the Continent house-worship is
strong enough in all conscience; but in France, in Spain, in
Italy, even in Germany, people do think of something beyond the
house.&nbsp; But here, where there are no romantic crimes, to get
a genteel house, to keep (or &ldquo;run&rdquo;) a <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>genteel house, or to pretend to keep (or
&ldquo;run&rdquo;) a genteel house, is the great first cause of
almost every British delinquency, from envy and malignant slander
up to forgery, robbery, and murder.&nbsp; And yet it is a fact,
as Borrow discovered (when a mere lad in a solicitor&rsquo;s
office), that to men in health the house need not, and should
not, be the all-absorbing consideration, but should be quite
secondary to considerations of honesty and sweet air, pure water,
clean linen, good manners, freedom to migrate at will, and, above
all, freedom from &ldquo;all cares or fears of law&rdquo; that
may come against a man in the shape of debts, duns, and
tax-gatherers.</p>
<p>Against this folly of softening our bodies by
&ldquo;snugness&rdquo; and degrading our souls by
&ldquo;flunkeyism,&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s early life was a
protest.&nbsp; He saw that if it were really unwholesome for man
to be shone upon by the sun, blown upon by the winds, and rained
upon by the rain, like all the other animals, man would never
have existed at all, for sun and wind and rain have produced him
and everything that lives.&nbsp; He saw that for the cultivation
of health, honesty, and good behaviour every man born in the
temperate zone ought, unless King Circumstance says
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; to spend in the open air eight or nine hours at
least out of the twenty-four, and ought to court rather than to
shun Nature&rsquo;s sweet shower-bath the rain, unless, of
course, his chest is weak.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>The evanescence of literary fame is strikingly
illustrated by recalling at this moment my first sight of
Borrow.&nbsp; I could not have been much more than a boy, for I
and a friend had gone down to Yarmouth in March to enjoy the
luxury of bathing in a Yarmouth sea, and it is certainly a
&ldquo;good while&rdquo;&mdash;to use Borrow&rsquo;s
phrase&mdash;since I considered <i>that</i> a luxury suitable to
March.&nbsp; On the morning after our arrival, having walked some
distance out of Yarmouth, we threw down our clothes and towels
upon the sand some few yards from another heap of clothes, which
indicated, to our surprise, that we were not, after all, the only
people in Yarmouth who could bathe in a biting wind; and soon we
perceived, ducking in an immense billow that came curving and
curling towards the shore, such a pair of shoulders as I had not
seen for a long time, crowned by a head white and glistening as
burnished silver.&nbsp; (Borrow&rsquo;s hair was white I believe,
when he was quite a young man.)&nbsp; When the wave had broken
upon the sand, there was the bather wallowing on the top of the
water like a Polar bear disporting in an Arctic sun.&nbsp; In
swimming Borrow clawed the water like a dog.&nbsp; I had plunged
into the surf and got very close to the swimmer, whom I perceived
to be a man of almost gigantic proportions, when suddenly an
instinct told me that it was Lavengro himself, who lived
thereabouts, and the feeling that it was he so entirely <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>stopped the action of my heart that I sank for a moment
like a stone, soon to rise again, however, in glow of pleasure
and excitement: so august a presence was Lavengro&rsquo;s
then!</p>
<p>I ought to say, however, that Borrow was at that time my
hero.&nbsp; From my childhood I had taken the deepest interest in
proscribed races such as the Cagots, but especially in the
persecuted children of Roma.&nbsp; I had read accounts of whole
families being executed in past times for no other crime than
that of their being born gipsies, and tears, childish and yet
bitter, had I shed over their woes.&nbsp; Now Borrow was the
recognized champion of the gipsies&mdash;the friend companion,
indeed, of the proscribed and persecuted races of the
world.&nbsp; Nor was this all: I saw in him more of the true
Nature instinct than in any other writer&mdash;or so, at least, I
imagined.&nbsp; To walk out from a snug house at Rydal Mount for
the purpose of making poetical sketches for publication seemed to
me a very different thing from having no home but a tent in a
dingle, or rather from Borrow&rsquo;s fashion of making all
Nature your home.&nbsp; Although I would have given worlds to go
up and speak to him as he was tossing his clothes upon his back,
I could not do it.&nbsp; Morning after morning did I see him
undress, wallow in the sea, come out again, give me a somewhat
sour look, dress, and then stride away inland at a tremendous
pace, but never could I speak to <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>him; and many
years passed before I saw him again.&nbsp; He was then half
forgotten.</p>
<p>For an introduction to him at last I was indebted to Dr.
Gordon Hake, the poet, who had known Borrow for many years, and
whose friendship Borrow cherished above most things&mdash;as was
usual, indeed, with the friends of Dr. Hake.&nbsp; This was done
with some difficulty, for, in calling at Roehampton for a walk
through Richmond Park and about the Common, Borrow&rsquo;s first
question was always, &ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; and no
persuasion could induce him to stay unless it could be
satisfactorily shown that he would not be &ldquo;pestered by
strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; On a certain morning, however, he called,
and suddenly coming upon me, there was no retreating, and we were
introduced.&nbsp; He tried to be as civil as possible, but
evidently he was much annoyed.&nbsp; Yet there was something in
the very tone of his voice that drew my heart to him, for to me
he was the Lavengro of my boyhood still.&nbsp; My own shyness had
been long before fingered off by the rough handling of the world,
but his retained all the bloom of youth, and a terrible barrier
it was, yet I attacked it manfully.&nbsp; I knew that Borrow had
read but little except in his own out-of-the-way directions; but
then unfortunately, like all specialists, he considered that in
these his own special directions lay all the knowledge that was
of any value.&nbsp; Accordingly, what appeared to Borrow <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>as the most striking characteristic of the present age
was its ignorance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too, I knew that for strangers to talk of his
own published books or of gipsies appeared to him to be
&ldquo;prying,&rdquo; though there I should have been quite at
home.&nbsp; I knew, however, that in the obscure English pamphlet
literature of the last century, recording the sayings and doings
of eccentric people and strange adventurers, Borrow was very
learned, and I too chanced to be far from ignorant in that
direction.&nbsp; I touched on Bamfylde Moore Carew, but without
effect.&nbsp; Borrow evidently considered that every properly
educated man was familiar with the story of Bamfylde Moore Carew
in its every detail.&nbsp; Then I touched upon beer, the British
bruiser, &ldquo;gentility-nonsense,&rdquo; the &ldquo;trumpery
great&rdquo;; then upon etymology, traced hoity-toityism to
<i>toit</i>, a roof,&mdash;but only to have my shallow philology
dismissed with a withering smile.&nbsp; I tried other subjects in
the same direction, but with small success, till in a lucky
moment I bethought myself of Ambrose Gwinett.&nbsp; There is a
very scarce eighteenth-century pamphlet narrating the story of
Ambrose Gwinett, the man who, after having been hanged and
gibbeted for murdering a traveller with whom he had shared a
double-bedded room at a seaside inn, revived in the night,
escaped from the gibbet irons, went to sea as a common sailor,
and afterwards met on a British man-of-war <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the very man
he had been hanged for murdering.&nbsp; The truth was that
Gwinett&rsquo;s supposed victim, having been attacked on the
night in question by a violent bleeding at the nose, had risen
and left the house for a few minutes&rsquo; walk in the
sea-breeze, when the press-gang captured him and bore him off to
sea, where he had been in service ever since.&nbsp; The story is
true, and the pamphlet, Borrow afterwards told me (I know not on
what authority), was written by Goldsmith from Gwinett&rsquo;s
dictation for a platter of cowheel.</p>
<p>To the bewilderment of Dr. Hake, I introduced the subject of
Ambrose Gwinett in the same manner as I might have introduced the
story of &ldquo;Achilles&rsquo; wrath,&rdquo; and appealed to Dr.
Hake (who, of course, had never heard of the book or the man) as
to whether a certain incident in the pamphlet had gained or lost
by the dramatist who, at one of the minor theatres, had many
years ago dramatized the story.&nbsp; Borrow was caught at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know that
pamphlet about Ambrose Gwinett?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Know
it?&rdquo; said I, in a hurt tone, as though he had asked me if I
knew &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo;; &ldquo;of course I know Ambrose
Gwinett, Mr. Borrow, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you
know the play?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I do, Mr.
Borrow?&rdquo; I said, in a tone that was now a little angry at
such an insinuation of crass ignorance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s years and <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>years since
it was acted; I never was much of a theatre man, but I did go to
see <i>that</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I should rather think
you <i>did</i>, Mr. Borrow,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, staring hard at me,
&ldquo;<i>you</i>&mdash;you were not born!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I was not born,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when the
&lsquo;Agamemnon&rsquo; was produced, and yet one reads the
&lsquo;Agamemnon,&rsquo; Mr. Borrow.&nbsp; I have read the drama
of &lsquo;Ambrose Gwinett.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have it bound in
morocco with some more of Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s early
transpontine plays, and some &AElig;schylean dramas by Mr.
Fitzball.&nbsp; I will lend it to you, Mr. Borrow, if you
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was completely conquered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hake!&rdquo; he cried, in a loud voice, regardless of my
presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hake! your friend knows
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he murmured to himself,
&ldquo;Wonderful man!&nbsp; Knows Ambrose Gwinett!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is such delightful reminiscences as these that will cause
me to have as long as I live a very warm place in my heart for
the memory of George Borrow.</p>
<p>From that time I used to see Borrow often at Roehampton,
sometimes at Putney, and sometimes, but not often, in
London.&nbsp; I could have seen much more of him than I did had
not the whirlpool of London, into which I plunged for a time,
borne me away from this most original of men; and this is what I
so greatly lament now: for of Borrow it may be said, as it was
said of a greater man still, that <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>&ldquo;after
Nature made <i>him</i> she forthwith broke the
mould.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last time I ever saw him was shortly
before he left London to live in the country.&nbsp; It was, I
remember well, on Waterloo Bridge, where I had stopped to gaze at
a sunset of singular and striking splendour, whose gorgeous
clouds and ruddy mists were reeling and boiling over the
West-End.&nbsp; Borrow came up and stood leaning over the
parapet, entranced by the sight, as well he might be.&nbsp; Like
most people born in flat districts, he had a passion for
sunsets.&nbsp; Turner could not have painted that one, I think,
and certainly my pen could not describe it; for the London smoke
was flushed by the sinking sun and had lost its dunness, and,
reddening every moment as it rose above the roofs, steeples, and
towers, it went curling round the sinking sun in a rosy vapour,
leaving, however, just a segment of a golden rim, which gleamed
as dazzlingly as in the thinnest and clearest air&mdash;a
peculiar effect which struck Borrow deeply.&nbsp; I never saw
such a sunset before or since, not even on Waterloo Bridge; and
from its association with &ldquo;the last of Borrow&rdquo; I
shall never forget it.</p>
<h3><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>III.</h3>
<p>Students of Borrow will be as much surprised as pleased to
find what a large collection of documents Dr. Knapp has been able
to use in compiling this long-expected biography. <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; Indeed, the collection might have
been larger and richer still.&nbsp; For instance, in the original
manuscript of &lsquo;Zincali&rsquo; (in the possession of the
present writer) there are some variations from the printed text;
but, what is of very much more importance, the whole&mdash;or
nearly the whole&mdash;of Borrow&rsquo;s letters to the Bible
Society, which Dr. Knapp believed to be lost, have been
discovered in the crypt of the Bible House in which the records
of the Society are stored.&nbsp; But even without these materials
two massive volumes crammed with documents throwing light upon
the life and career of a man like George Borrow must needs be
interesting to the student of English literature.&nbsp; For among
all the remarkable characters that during the middle of the
present century figured in the world of letters, the most
eccentric, the most whimsical, and in every way the most <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>extraordinary was surely the man whom Dr. Knapp calls,
appropriately enough, his &ldquo;hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that there was not a single point
in which Borrow resembled any other writing man of his time;
indeed, we cannot, at the moment, recall any really important
writer of any period whose eccentricity of character can be
compared with his.&nbsp; At the basis of the artistic temperament
is generally that &ldquo;sweet reasonableness&rdquo; the lack of
which we excuse in Borrow and in almost no one else.&nbsp; As to
literary whim, it must not be supposed that this quality is
necessarily and always the outcome of temperament.&nbsp; There
are some authors of whom it may be said that the moment they take
pen in hand they pass into their &ldquo;literary mood,&rdquo; a
mood that in their cases does not seem to be born of temperament,
but to spring from some fantastic movement of the
intellect.&nbsp; Sterne, for instance, the greatest of all
masters of whim (not excluding Rabelais), passed when in the act
of writing into a literary mood which, as &ldquo;Yorick,&rdquo;
he tried to live up to in his private life&mdash;tried in
vain.&nbsp; With regard to Charles Lamb, his temperament, no
doubt, was whimsical enough, and yet how many rich and rare
passages in his writings are informed by a whim of a purely
intellectual kind&mdash;a whim which could only have sprung from
that delicious literary mood of his, engendered by much <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>study
of quaint old writers, into which he passed when at his
desk!&nbsp; But whatsoever is whimsical, whatsoever is eccentric
and angular, in Borrow&rsquo;s writings is the natural, the
inevitable growth of a nature more whimsical, more eccentric,
more angular still.</p>
<p>That such a man should have had an extraordinary
life-experience was to be expected.&nbsp; And an extraordinary
life-experience Borrow&rsquo;s was, to be sure!&nbsp; This alone
would lend an especial interest to Borrow&rsquo;s
biography&mdash;the fact, we mean, of his life having been
extraordinary.&nbsp; For in these days no lives, as a rule, are
less adventurous, none, as a rule, less tinged with romance, than
the lives of those who attain eminence in the world of
letters.&nbsp; No doubt they nowadays move about from place to
place a good deal; not a few of them may even be called
travellers, or at least globe-trotters; but, alas! in
globe-trotting who shall hope to meet with adventures of a more
romantic kind than those connected with a railway collision or a
storm at sea?&nbsp; And this was so in days that preceded
ours.&nbsp; It was so with Scott, it was so with Dickens, it was
so with even Dumas, who, chained to his desk for months and
months at a stretch, could only be seen by his friends during the
intervals of work.&nbsp; Nay, even with regard to the writing men
of the far past, the more time a man gave to literary production
the less time he had to drink the rich wine of life, to see <!--
page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>the world, to study nature and nature&rsquo;s enigma
man.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason why we have almost no record of what the
greatest of all writing men was doing in the world is that while
his friends were elbowing the tide of life in the streets of
London, or fighting in the Low Countries, or carousing at the
Mermaid Tavern, or at the Apollo Saloon, he was filling every
moment with work&mdash;work which enabled him, before he reached
his fifty-second year, to build up that literary monument of his,
that edifice which made the monuments of the others, his
contemporaries, seem like the handiwork of pigmies.&nbsp; But as
regards Borrow, student though he was, it is not as an author
that we think of him; it is as the adventurer, it is as the great
Romany Rye, who discovered the most interesting people in Europe,
and as a brother vagabond lived with them&mdash;lived with them
&ldquo;on the accont of health, sweetness of the air, and for
enjoying the pleasure of Nature&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; to quote the
&ldquo;testimonial&rdquo; of the prose-poet Sylvester
Boswell.</p>
<p>Even by his personal appearance Borrow was marked off from his
fellow-men.&nbsp; As a gipsy girl once remarked, &ldquo;Nobody as
ever see&rsquo;d the white-headed Romany Rye ever forgot
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Standing considerably above six feet in height,
he was built as perfectly as a Greek statue, and his practice of
athletic <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>exercises gave his every movement the
easy elasticity of an athlete under training.&nbsp; As to his
countenance, &ldquo;noble&rdquo; is the only word that can be
used to describe it.&nbsp; The silvery whiteness of the thick
crop of hair seemed to add in a remarkable way to the beauty of
the hairless face, but also it gave a strangeness to it, and this
strangeness was intensified by a certain incongruity between the
features (perfect Roman-Greek in type) and the Scandinavian
complexion, luminous and sometimes rosy as an English
girl&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An increased intensity was lent by the fair
skin to the dark lustre of the eyes.&nbsp; What struck the
observer, therefore, was not the beauty but the strangeness of
the man&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp; It was not this feature or that
which struck the eye, it was the expression of the face as a
whole.&nbsp; If it were possible to describe this expression in a
word or two, it might, perhaps, be called a shy
self-consciousness.</p>
<p>How did it come about, then, that a man shy, self-conscious,
and sensitive to the last degree, became the Ulysses of the
writing fraternity, wandering among strangers all over Europe,
and consorting on intimate terms with that race who, more than
all others, are repelled by shy self-consciousness&mdash;the
gipsies?&nbsp; This, perhaps, is how the puzzle may be
explained.&nbsp; When Borrow was talking to people in his own
class of life there was always in his bearing a kind <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of
shy, defiant egotism.&nbsp; What Carlyle calls the &ldquo;armed
neutrality&rdquo; of social intercourse oppressed him.&nbsp; He
felt himself to be in the enemy&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; In his eyes
there was always a kind of watchfulness, as if he were taking
stock of his interlocutor and weighing him against himself.&nbsp;
He seemed to be observing what effect his words were having, and
this attitude repelled people at first.&nbsp; But the moment he
approached a gipsy on the heath, or a poor Jew in Houndsditch, or
a homeless wanderer by the wayside, he became another man.&nbsp;
He threw off the burden of restraint.&nbsp; The feeling of the
&ldquo;armed neutrality&rdquo; was left behind, and he seemed to
be at last enjoying the only social intercourse that could give
him pleasure.&nbsp; This it was that enabled him to make friends
so entirely with the gipsies.&nbsp; Notwithstanding what is
called &ldquo;Romany guile&rdquo; (which is the growth of ages of
oppression), the basis of the Romany character is a joyous
frankness.&nbsp; Once let the isolating wall which shuts off the
Romany from the &ldquo;Gorgio&rdquo; be broken through, and the
communicativeness of the Romany temperament begins to show
itself.&nbsp; The gipsies are extremely close observers; they
were very quick to notice how different was Borrow&rsquo;s
bearing towards themselves from his bearing towards people of his
own race, and Borrow used to say that &ldquo;old Mrs. Herne and
Leonora were <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the only gipsies who suspected and
disliked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the gipsies and the wanderers
generally were almost the only people in any country who saw the
winsome side of Borrow.&nbsp; A truly winsome side he had.&nbsp;
Yes, notwithstanding all that has been said about him to the
contrary, Borrow was a most interesting and charming
companion.&nbsp; We all have our angularities; we all have
unpleasant facets of character when occasion offers for showing
them.&nbsp; But there are some unfortunate people whose
angularities are for ever chafing and irritating their
friends.&nbsp; Borrow was one of these.&nbsp; It is very rarely
indeed that one meets a friend or an acquaintance of
Borrow&rsquo;s who speaks of him with the kindness he
deserved.&nbsp; When a friend or an acquaintance relates an
anecdote of him the asperity with which he does so is really
remarkable and quite painful.&nbsp; It was&mdash;it must have
been&mdash;far from Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s wish to speak
unkindly of his old friend who remained to the last deeply
attached to him.&nbsp; And yet few things have done more to
prejudice the public against Borrow than the Doctor&rsquo;s tale
of Lavengro&rsquo;s outrage at Rougham Rookery, the residence of
the banker Bevan, one of the kindest and most benevolent men in
Suffolk.</p>
<p>This story, often told by Hake, appeared at last in print in
his memoirs.&nbsp; Invited to dinner <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>by Mr. Bevan,
Borrow accepted the invitation and, according to the anecdote,
thus behaved: During dinner Mrs. Bevan, thinking to please him,
said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Borrow, I have read your books with so much
pleasure!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which Borrow exclaimed, &ldquo;Pray
what books do you mean, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;do you mean my account
books?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, rising from the table, he walked up and
down among the servants during the whole dinner, and afterwards
wandered about the rooms and passages till the carriage could be
ordered for his return home.&nbsp; A monstrous proceeding truly,
and not to be condoned by any circumstances.&nbsp; Yet some part
of its violence may, perhaps, thus be explained.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s loyalty to a friend was proverbial&mdash;until he
and the friend quarrelled.&nbsp; A man who dared say an
ungenerous word against a friend of Borrow&rsquo;s ran the risk
of being knocked down.&nbsp; Borrow on this occasion had been
driven half mad with rage&mdash;unreasoning, ignorant
rage&mdash;against the Bury banking-house, because it had
&ldquo;struck the docket&rdquo; against a friend of
Borrow&rsquo;s, the heir to a considerable estate, who had got
into difficulties.&nbsp; What Borrow yearned to do was, as he
told the present writer, to cane the banker.&nbsp; He had, as far
as his own reputation went, far better have done this and taken
the consequences than have insulted the banker&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;one of the most gentle, amiable, and unassuming ladies
in <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Suffolk.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp speaks very sharply of Miss
Cobb&rsquo;s remarks upon Borrow, and certainly these remarks are
made with a great deal too much acidity.&nbsp; But if the
Borrovian is to lose temper with every one who girds at Borrow he
will lead a not very comfortable life.</p>
<p>Dr. Knapp has no doubt whatever that &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is
in the main an autobiography.&nbsp; We have none.&nbsp; The only
question is how much <i>Dichtung</i> is mingled with the
<i>Wahrheit</i>.&nbsp; Had it not been for the amazingly clumsy
pieces of fiction which he threw into the narrative&mdash;such
incidents as that of his meeting on the road the sailor son of
the old apple-woman of London Bridge, and the exaggerated
description of the man sent to sleep by reading
Wordsworth&mdash;few readers would have doubted the
autobiographical nature of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Romany Rye.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such incidents as these shed an air of
unreality over the whole.</p>
<p>All writers upon Borrow fall into the mistake of considering
him to have been an East Anglian.&nbsp; They might as well call
Charlotte Bront&euml; a Yorkshirewoman as call Borrow an East
Anglian.&nbsp; He was, of course, no more an East Anglian than an
Irishman born in London is an Englishman.&nbsp; He had at bottom
no East Anglian characteristics.&nbsp; He inherited nothing from
Norfolk save his accent and his love of &ldquo;leg of mutton and
turnips.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he is a striking illustration of the
way in which the locality <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>that has
given birth to a man influences him throughout his life.&nbsp;
The fact of Borrow&rsquo;s having been born in East Anglia was
the result of accident.&nbsp; His father, a Cornishman of a good
middle-class family, had been obliged, owing to a youthful
escapade, to leave his native place and enlist as a common
soldier.&nbsp; Afterwards he became a recruiting officer, and
moved about from one part of Great Britain and Ireland to
another.&nbsp; It so chanced that while staying at East Dereham,
in Norfolk, he met and fell in love with a lady of French
extraction.&nbsp; Not one drop of East Anglian blood was in the
veins of Borrow&rsquo;s father, and very little in the veins of
his mother.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s ancestry was pure Cornish on one
side, and on the other mainly French.&nbsp; But such was the
sublime egotism of Borrow&mdash;perhaps we should have said such
is the sublime egotism of human nature&mdash;that the fact of his
having been born in East Anglia made him look upon that part of
the world as the very hub of the universe.</p>
<p>There is, it must be confessed, something to us very agreeable
in Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s single-minded hero-worship.&nbsp; A scholar
and a philologist himself, he seems to have devoted a large
portion of his life to the study of Borrow&mdash;following in
Lavengro&rsquo;s footsteps from one country to another with
unflagging enthusiasm.&nbsp; Now and again, undoubtedly, this
hero-worship runs to excess: the faults of style and of method in
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Borrow&rsquo;s writings are condoned or are passed by
unobserved by Dr. Knapp, while the most unanswerable strictures
upon them by others are resented.&nbsp; For instance, at the end
of the following extract from the report of the gentleman who
read &lsquo;Zincali&rsquo; for Mr. Murray, he appends a note of
exclamation, as though he considers the admirable advice given to
be eccentric or bad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Dialogues are amongst the best parts of
the book; but in several of them the tone of the speakers, of
those especially who are in humble life, is too correct and
elevated, and therefore out of character.&nbsp; This takes away
from their effect.&nbsp; I think it would be very advisable that
Mr. Borrow should go over them with reference to this point,
simplifying a few of the terms of expression and introducing a
few contractions&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;ts</i>, <i>can&rsquo;ts</i>,
&amp;c.&nbsp; This would improve them greatly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the truth is that Mr. Murray&rsquo;s reader, whoever he
was, <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> pointed out the one great blemish in
<i>all</i> Borrow&rsquo;s dramatic pictures of gipsy life,
wheresoever the scene may be laid.&nbsp; Take his pictures of
English gipsies.&nbsp; The reader has only to compare the
dialogue between gipsies given in that photographic study of
Romany life &lsquo;In Gipsy Tents&rsquo; with the dialogues in
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; to see how the <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>illusion in
Borrow&rsquo;s narrative is disturbed by the uncolloquial
vocabulary of the speakers.&nbsp; After all allowance is made for
the Romany&rsquo;s love of high-sounding words, it considerably
weakens our belief in Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro, Ursula, and the
rest, to find them using complex sentences and bookish words
which, even among English people, are rarely heard in
conversation.</p>
<p>Dr. Knapp says emphatically that Borrow never created a
character, and that the originals are easily recognizable to one
who thoroughly knows the times and Borrow&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp;
This is true, no doubt, as regards people with whom he was
brought into contact at Norwich, and, indeed, generally before
the period of his gipsy wanderings.&nbsp; It must not be
supposed, however, that such characters as the man who
&ldquo;touched&rdquo; to avert the evil chance and the man who
taught himself Chinese are in any sense portraits.&nbsp; They
have so many of Borrow&rsquo;s own peculiarities that they might
rather be called portraits of himself.&nbsp; There was nothing
that Borrow strove against with more energy than the curious
impulse, which he seems to have shared with Dr. Johnson, to touch
the objects along his path in order to save himself from the evil
chance.&nbsp; He never conquered the superstition.&nbsp; In
walking through Richmond Park he would step out of his way
constantly to touch a tree, and he was offended if the <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>friend he was with seemed to observe it.&nbsp; Many of
the peculiarities of the man who taught himself Chinese were also
Borrow&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Isopel Berners?&rdquo; the reader will
ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much of truth and how much of fiction went
to the presentation of this most interesting
character?&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing that Dr. Knapp has at his command
such an immense amount of material in manuscript, the reader will
feel some disappointment at discovering that the book tells us
nothing new about her.&nbsp; The character he names Isopel
Berners was just the sort of girl in every way to attract Borrow,
and if he had had the feeblest spark of the love-passion in his
constitution one could almost imagine his falling in love with
her.&nbsp; Yet even the portrait of Isopel is marred by
Borrow&rsquo;s impulse towards exaggeration.&nbsp; He must needs
describe her as being taller than himself, and as he certainly
stood six feet three Isopel would have been far better suited to
sit by the side of Borrow&rsquo;s friend the &ldquo;Norfolk
giant,&rdquo; Hales, in the little London public-house where he
latterly resided, than to become famous as a fighting woman who
could conquer the Flaming Tinman.&nbsp; Few indeed have been the
women who could stand up for long before a trained boxer, and
these must needs be not too tall, and moreover they must have
their breasts padded after the manner of a well-known gipsy girl
who excelled in this once <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>fashionable
accomplishment.&nbsp; Even then a woman&rsquo;s instinct impels
her to guard her chest more carefully than she guards her face,
and this leads to disaster.&nbsp; Altogether Borrow, by his
wilful exaggeration, makes the reader a little sceptical about
Isopel, who was really an East Anglian road-girl of the finest
type, known to the Boswells, and remembered not many years
ago.&nbsp; All that Dr. Knapp has derived from the documents in
his possession concerning her is the following extraordinary
passage from the original manuscript, which Borrow struck out of
&lsquo;Lavengro.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As to the remarkable character introduced
into &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;Romany Rye&rsquo; under
the name of Isopel Berners, I have no light from the MSS. of
George Borrow, save the following fragment, which perhaps I ought
to have suppressed.&nbsp; I am sorry if it dispel any
illusions:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(<i>Loquitur Petulengro</i>) &lsquo;My mind at present
rather inclines towards two wives.&nbsp; I have heard that King
Pharaoh had two, if not more.&nbsp; Now, I think myself as good a
man as he; and if he had more wives than one, why should not I,
whose name is Petulengro?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But what would Mrs. Petulengro say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, to tell you the truth, brother, it was she
who first put the thought into my mind.&nbsp; She has always, you
know, had strange notions in her head, gorgiko notions, I suppose
we may call them, about gentility and the like, and reading and
writing.&nbsp; Now, though she can <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>neither read
nor write herself, she thinks that she is lost among our people
and that they are no society for her.&nbsp; So says she to me one
day, &ldquo;Pharaoh,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I wish you would
take another wife, that I might have a little pleasant
company.&nbsp; As for these here, I am their
betters.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;who shall it be?&nbsp; Shall it be a Cooper or a
Stanley?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A Cooper or a Stanley!&rdquo; said
she, with a toss of her head, &ldquo;I might as well keep my
present company as theirs; none of your rubbish; let it be a
<i>gorgie</i>, one that I can speak an idea
with&rdquo;&mdash;that was her word, I think.&nbsp; Now I am
thinking that this here Bess of yours would be just the kind of
person both for my wife and myself.&nbsp; My wife wants something
gorgiko, something genteel.&nbsp; Now Bess is of blood gorgious;
if you doubt it, look in her face, all full of <i>pawno
ratter</i>, white blood, brother; and as for gentility, nobody
can make exceptions to Bess&rsquo;s gentility, seeing she was
born in the workhouse of Melford the Short, where she learned to
read and write.&nbsp; She is no Irish woman, brother, but English
pure, and her father was a farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So much as far as my wife is concerned.&nbsp; As
for myself, I tell you what, brother, I want a strapper; one who
can give and take.&nbsp; The Flying Tinker is abroad, vowing
vengeance against us all.&nbsp; I know what the Flying Tinker is,
so does Tawno.&nbsp; The Flying Tinker came to our camp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Damn you all,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight the
best of you for nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; says
Tawno, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready for you in a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Tawno went into his tent and came out
<!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>naked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s at you,&rdquo; says
Tawno.&nbsp; Brother, Tawno fought for two hours with the Flying
Tinker, for two whole hours, and it&rsquo;s hard to say which had
the best of it or the worst.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, I
think Tawno had the worst of it.&nbsp; Night came on.&nbsp; Tawno
went into his tent to dress himself and the Flying Tinker went
his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now suppose, brother, the Flying Tinker comes
upon us when Tawno is away.&nbsp; Who is to fight the Flying
Tinker when he says: &ldquo;D---n you, I will fight the best of
you&rdquo;?&nbsp; Brother, I will fight the Flying Tinker for
five pounds; but I couldn&rsquo;t for less.&nbsp; The Flying
Tinker is a big man, and though he hasn&rsquo;t my science, he
weighs five stone heavier.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t do for me to
fight a man like that for nothing.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s Bess,
who can afford to fight the Flying Tinker at any time for what
he&rsquo;s got, and that&rsquo;s three ha&rsquo;pence.&nbsp; She
can beat him, brother; I bet five pounds that Bess can beat the
Flying Tinker.&nbsp; Now, if I marry Bess, I&rsquo;m quite easy
on his score.&nbsp; He comes to our camp and says his say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dirty my hands with you,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;at least not under five pounds; but here&rsquo;s Bess
who&rsquo;ll fight you for nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I tell you what,
brother, when he knows that Bess is Mrs. Pharaoh, he&rsquo;ll
fight shy of our camp; he won&rsquo;t come near it,
brother.&nbsp; He knows Bess don&rsquo;t like him, and
what&rsquo;s more, that she can lick him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll let
us alone; at least I think so.&nbsp; If he does come, I&rsquo;ll
smoke my pipe whilst Bess is beating the Flying Tinker.&nbsp;
Brother, I&rsquo;m dry, and will now take a cup of
ale.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Why did Borrow reject this passage?&nbsp; Was it owing
to his dread of respectability&rsquo;s frowns?&mdash;or was it
not rather because he felt that here his exaggeration, his
departure from the true in quest of the striking, did not
recommend itself to his cooler judgment?&nbsp; For those who know
anything of the gipsies would say at once that it would have been
impossible for Mrs. Petulengro to make this suggestion; and that,
even if she had made it, Mr. Petulengro would not have dared to
broach it to any English road-girl, least of all to a girl like
Isopel Berners.&nbsp; The passage, however, is the most
interesting document that Dr. Knapp has published.</p>
<p>What may be called the Isopel Berners chapter of
Borrow&rsquo;s life was soon to be followed by the &ldquo;veiled
period&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the period between the point
where ends &lsquo;The Romany Rye&rsquo; and the point where the
Bible Society engages Borrow.</p>
<p>Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s mind seems a good deal exercised concerning
this period.&nbsp; Borrow having chosen to draw the veil over
that period, no one has any right to raise it&mdash;or, rather,
perhaps no one would have had any right to do so had not Borrow
himself thrown such a needless mystery around it.&nbsp; In
considering any matter in connexion with Borrow it is always
necessary to take into account the secretiveness of his
disposition, and also his passion for posing.&nbsp; He had a
child&rsquo;s fondness for the wonderful.&nbsp; It <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>is
through his own love of mystification that students like Dr.
Knapp must needs pry into these matters&mdash;must needs ask why
Borrow drew the veil over seven years&mdash;must needs ask
whether during the &ldquo;veiled period&rdquo; he led a life of
squalid misery, compared with which his sojourn with Isopel
Berners in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle was luxury, or whether he was
really travelling, as he pretended to have been, over the
world.</p>
<p>By yielding to his instinct as a born showman he excites a
curiosity which would otherwise be unjustifiable.&nbsp; Even if
Dr. Knapp had been able to approach Borrow&rsquo;s
stepdaughter&mdash;which he seems not to have been able to
do&mdash;it is pretty certain that she could have told him
nothing of that mysterious seven years.&nbsp; For about this
subject the people to whom Borrow seems to have been most
reticent were his wife and her daughter.&nbsp; Indeed, it was not
until after his wife&rsquo;s death that he would allude to this
period even to his most intimate friends.&nbsp; One of the very
few people to whom he did latterly talk with anything like
frankness about this period in his life&mdash;Dr. Gordon
Hake&mdash;is dead; and perhaps there is not more than about one
other person now living who had anything of his confidence.</p>
<p>With regard to this veiled period, people who read the idyllic
pictures in &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Romany
Rye&rsquo; of the life of a gipsy gentleman working as a
hedge-smith in the <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>dingle or by the roadside seem to
forget that Borrow was then working not for amusement, but for
bread, and they forget how scant the bread must have been that
could be bought for the odd sixpence or the few coppers that he
was able to earn.&nbsp; To those, however, who do not forget this
it needs no revelation from documents, and none from any
surviving friend, to come to the conclusion that as Borrow was
mainly living in England during these seven years (continuing for
a considerable time his life of a wanderer, and afterwards living
as an obscure literary struggler in Norwich), his life was during
this period one of privation, disappointment, and gloom.&nbsp; It
was for him to decide what he would give to the public and what
he would withhold.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s book is not only
pathetic&mdash;it is painful.&nbsp; In the summer of 1874 Borrow
left London, bade adieu to Mr. Murray and a few friends, and
returned to Oulton&mdash;to die.&nbsp; On the 26th of July, 1881,
he was found dead in his home at Oulton, in his seventy-ninth
year.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p>At Birchington-on-Sea one of the most rarely gifted men of our
time has just died [April 9th, 1882] after a lingering
illness.&nbsp; During the time that his &lsquo;Ballads and
Sonnets&rsquo; was passing through the press last autumn his
health began to give way, and he left London for
Cumberland.&nbsp; A stay of a few weeks in the Vale of St. John,
however, did nothing to improve his health, and he returned much
shattered.&nbsp; After a time a numbness in the left arm excited
fear of paralysis, and he became dangerously ill.&nbsp; It is
probable, indeed, that nothing but the skill and unwearied
attention of Mr. John Marshall saved his life then, as it had
done upon several previous occasions.&nbsp; Such of his friends
as were then in London&mdash;W. B. Scott, Burne Jones, Leyland,
F. Shields, Mr. Dunn, and others&mdash;feeling the greatest
alarm, showed him every affectionate attention, and spared no
effort to preserve a life so precious and so beloved.&nbsp; Mr.
Seddon having placed at his disposal West Cliff Bungalow,
Birchington-on-Sea, <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span

<p>Were I even competent to enter upon the discussion of
Rossetti&rsquo;s gifts as a poet and as a painter, it would not
be possible to do so here and at this moment.&nbsp; That the
quality of romantic imagination informs with more vitality his
work than it can be said to inform the work of any of his
contemporaries was recognized at first by the few, and is now
(judging from the great popularity of his last volume of poetry)
being recognized by the many.&nbsp; And the same, I think, may be
said of his painting.&nbsp; Those who had the privilege of a
personal acquaintance with him knew how &ldquo;of imagination all
compact&rdquo; he was.&nbsp; Imagination, indeed, was at once his
blessing and his bane.&nbsp; To see too vividly&mdash;to love too
intensely&mdash;to suffer and enjoy too acutely&mdash;is the
doom, no doubt, of all those &ldquo;lost wanderers from
Arden&rdquo; who, according to the Rosicrucian story, sing the
world&rsquo;s songs; and to Rossetti this applies more, perhaps,
than to most poets.&nbsp; And when we consider that the one
quality in all poetry which really gives it an endurance
outlasting the generation of its birth is neither music nor
colour, nor even intellectual substance, but the <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>clearness of the seeing; the living breath of
imagination&mdash;the very qualities, in short, for which such
poems as &lsquo;Sister Helen&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rose Mary&rsquo;
are so conspicuous&mdash;we are driven to the conclusion that
Rossetti&rsquo;s poetry has a long and enduring future before
it.</p>
<p>A life more devoted to literature and art than his it is
impossible to imagine.&nbsp; Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti was
born at 38, Charlotte Street, Portland Place, London, on the 12th
of May, 1828.&nbsp; He was the first son and second child of
Gabriele Rossetti, the patriotic poet, who, born at Vasto in the
Abruzzi, settled in Naples, and took an active part in extorting
from the Neapolitan king Ferdinand I. the constitution granted in
1820, which constitution being traitorously cancelled by the king
in 1821, Rossetti had to escape for his life to Malta with
various other persecuted constitutionalists.&nbsp; From Malta
Gabriele Rossetti went to England about 1823, where he married in
1826 Frances Polidori, daughter of Alfieri&rsquo;s secretary and
sister of Byron&rsquo;s Dr. Polidori.&nbsp; He became Professor
of Italian in King&rsquo;s College, London, became also prominent
as a commentator on Dante, and died in April, 1854.&nbsp; His
children, four in number&mdash;Maria Francesca, Dante Gabriel,
William Michael, and Christina Georgina&mdash;all turned to
literature or to art, or to both, and all became famous.&nbsp;
There can, indeed, be no doubt that the Rossetti <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>family will hold a position quite unique in the literary
and artistic annals of our time.</p>
<p>Young Rossetti was first sent to the private school of the
Rev. Mr. Paul in Foley Street, Portland Place, where he remained,
however, for only three quarters of a year, from the autumn of
1835 to the summer of 1836.&nbsp; He next went to King&rsquo;s
College School in the autumn of 1836, where he remained till the
summer of 1843, having reached the fourth class, then conducted
by the Rev. Mr. Framley.</p>
<p>Having from early childhood shown a strong propensity for
drawing and painting, which had thus been always regarded as his
future profession, he now left school for ever and received no
more school learning.&nbsp; In Latin he was already fairly
proficient for his age; French he knew well; he had spoken
Italian from childhood, and had some German lessons about
1844&ndash;5.&nbsp; On leaving school he went at once to the Art
Academy of Cary (previously called Sass&rsquo;s) near Bedford
Square, and thence obtained admission to the Royal Academy
Antique School in 1844 or 1845.&nbsp; To the Royal Academy Life
School he never went, and he was a somewhat negligent art
student, but always regarded as one who had a future before
him.</p>
<p>In 1849 Rossetti exhibited &lsquo;The Girlhood of the
Virgin&rsquo; in the so-called Free Exhibition or Portland
Gallery.&nbsp; The artist who had perhaps the strongest influence
upon Rossetti&rsquo;s <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>early tastes was Ford Madox Brown,
who, however, refused from the first to join the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood on the ground that coteries had in modern art no
proper function.&nbsp; Rossetti was deeply impressed with the
power and designing faculty displayed by Madox Brown&rsquo;s
cartoons exhibited in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; When Rossetti began
serious work as a painter he thought of Madox Brown as the one
man from whom he would willingly receive practical guidance, and
wrote to him at random.&nbsp; From this time Madox Brown became
his intimate friend and artistic monitor.</p>
<p>In painting, however, Rossetti was during this time exercising
only half his genius.&nbsp; From his childhood it became evident
that he was a poet.&nbsp; At the age of five he wrote a sort of
play called &lsquo;The Slave,&rsquo; which, as may be imagined,
showed no noteworthy characteristic save precocity.&nbsp; This
was followed by the poem called &lsquo;Sir Hugh Heron,&rsquo;
which was written about 1844, and some translations of German
poetry.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Blessed Damozel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sister
Helen&rsquo; were produced in their original form so early as
1846 or 1847.&nbsp; The latter of these has undergone more
modifications than any other first-class poem of our time.&nbsp;
To take even the new edition of the &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; which
appeared last year [1881], the stanzas introducing the wife of
the luckless hero appealing to the sorceress for mercy are so
important in the <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>glamour they shed back over the
stanzas that have gone before, that their introduction may almost
be characterized as a rewriting of every previous line.</p>
<p>The translations from the early Italian poets also began as
far back as 1845 or 1846, and may have been mainly completed by
1849.&nbsp; Rossetti&rsquo;s gifts as a translator were, no
doubt, of the highest.&nbsp; And this arose from his deep
sympathy with literature as a medium of human expression: he
could enter into the temperaments of other writers, and by
sympathy criticize the literary form from the author&rsquo;s own
inner standpoint, supposing always that there was a certain
racial kinship with the author.&nbsp; Many who write well
themselves have less sympathy with the expressional forms adopted
by other writers than is displayed by men who have neither the
impulse nor the power to write themselves.&nbsp; But this
sympathy betrayed him sometimes into a free rendering of
locutions such as a translator should be chary of indulging
in.&nbsp; Materials for a volume accumulated slowly, but all the
important portions of the &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; published in 1870
had been in existence some years before that date.&nbsp; The
prose story of &lsquo;Hand and Soul&rsquo; was also written as
early as 1848 or 1849.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1860 he married Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall,
who being very beautiful was constantly painted and drawn by
him.&nbsp; She <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>had one still-born child in 1861, and
died in February, 1862.&nbsp; He felt her death very acutely, and
for a time ceased to write or to take any interest in his own
poetry.&nbsp; Like Prospero, indeed, he literally buried his
wand, but for a time only.&nbsp; From this time to his death he
continued to produce pictures, all of them showing, as far as
technical skill goes, an unfaltering advance in his art.</p>
<p>Yet wonderful as was Rossetti as an artist and poet, he was
still more wonderful, I think, as a man.&nbsp; The chief
characteristic of his conversation was an incisiveness so perfect
and clear as to have often the pleasurable surprise of wit.&nbsp;
It is so well known that Rossetti has been for a long time the
most retired man of genius of our day, and so many absurd causes
for this retirement have been spoken of, that there is nothing
indecorous in the true cause of it being made public by one who
of late years has known more of him, perhaps, than has any other
person.&nbsp; About 1868 the curse of the artistic and poetic
temperament&mdash;insomnia&mdash;attacked him, and one of the
most distressing effects of insomnia is a nervous shrinking from
personal contact with any save a few intimate friends.&nbsp; This
peculiar kind of nervousness may be aggravated by the use of
sleeping draughts, and in his case was thus aggravated.</p>
<p>But, although Rossetti lived thus secluded, he did not lose
the affectionate regard of the <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>illustrious
men with whom he started in his artistic life.&nbsp; Nor,
assuredly, did he deserve to lose it, for no man ever lived, I
think, who was so generous as he in sympathizing with other
men&rsquo;s work, save only when the cruel fumes of chloral
turned him against everything.&nbsp; And his sympathy was as wide
as generous.&nbsp; It was only necessary to mention the name of
Leighton or Millais or Madox Brown or Burne Jones or G. F. Watts,
or, indeed, of any contemporary painter, to get from him a
glowing disquisition upon the merits of each&mdash;a disquisition
full of the subtlest distinctions, and illuminated by the
brilliant lights of his matchless fancy.&nbsp; And it was the
same in poetry.</p>
<p>But those who loved Rossetti (that is to say, those who knew
him) can realize how difficult it is for me, a friend, to pursue
just now such reminiscences as these.</p>
<h3><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>II.</h3>
<p>In his preface Mr. W. M. Rossetti says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have not attempted to write a
biographical account of my brother, nor to estimate the range or
value of his powers and performances in fine art and in
literature.&nbsp; I agree with those who think that a brother is
not the proper person to undertake a work of this sort.&nbsp; An
outsider can do it dispassionately, though with imperfect
knowledge of the facts; a friend can do it with mastery, and
without much undue bias; but a brother, however equitably he may
address himself to the task, cannot perform it so as to secure
the prompt and cordial assent of his readers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words will serve as a good example of the dignified
modesty which is a characteristic of Mr. W. M. Rossetti&rsquo;s,
and is one of the best features of this volume. <a
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; In these days of empty pretence
it is always refreshing to come upon a page written in the spirit
of scholarly self-suppression which informs every line this
patient and admirable critic writes.&nbsp; And as to the
interesting question glanced at in the passage above quoted,
though the contents of this volume will, no doubt, form valuable
material for the future biography of Rossetti, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>we wonder
whether the time is even yet at hand when that biography, whether
written by brother, by friend, or by outsider, is needed.&nbsp;
That mysterious entity &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; would, no doubt,
like to get one; but we have always shared Rossetti&rsquo;s own
opinion that a man of genius is no more the property of the
&ldquo;public&rdquo; than is any private gentleman; and we have
always felt with him that the prevalence in our time of the
opposite opinion has fashioned so intolerable a yoke for the neck
of any one who has had the misfortune to pass from the sweet
paradise of obscurity into the vulgar purgatory of Fame, that it
almost behoves a man of genius to avoid, if he can, passing into
that purgatory at all.</p>
<p>Can any biography, by whomsoever written, be other than
inchoate and illusory&mdash;nay, can it fail to be fraught with
danger to the memory of the dead, with danger to the peace of the
living, until years have fully calmed the air around the dead
man&rsquo;s grave?&nbsp; So long as the man to be portrayed
cannot be separated from his surroundings, so long as his
portrait cannot be fully and honestly limned without peril to the
peace of those among whom he moved&mdash;in a word, so long as
there remains any throb of vitality in those delicate filaments
of social life by which he was enlinked to those with whom he
played his part&mdash;that brother, or that friend, or that
outsider who shall attempt the portraiture <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>must feel
what heavy responsibilities are his&mdash;must not forget that
with him to trip is to sin against the head.&nbsp; And how shall
he decide when the time has at last come for making the
attempt?&nbsp; Before the incidents of a man&rsquo;s life can be
exploited without any risk of mischief, how much time should
elapse?&nbsp; &ldquo;A month,&rdquo; say the publishers, each one
of whom runs his own special &ldquo;biographical series,&rdquo;
and keeps his own special bevy of recording angels writing
against time and against each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty
years,&rdquo; said one whose life-wisdom was so perfect as to be
in a world like ours almost an adequate substitute for the
morality he lacked&mdash;Talleyrand.</p>
<p>Of all forms of literary art biography demands from the artist
not only the greatest courage, but also the happiest combination
of the highest gifts.&nbsp; To succeed in painting the portrait
of Achilles or of Priam, of Hamlet or of Othello, may be
difficult, but is it as difficult as to succeed in painting the
portrait of Browning or Rossetti?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; In the
one case an intense dramatic imagination is needed, and nothing
more.&nbsp; If Homer&rsquo;s Achaian and Trojan heroes were
falsely limned, not they, but Homer&rsquo;s art, would suffer the
injury.&nbsp; If for the purposes of art the poet unduly exalted
this one or unduly abased that&mdash;if he misread one incident
in the mythical life of Achilles, and another in the mythical
life of Hector&mdash;he did <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>wrong to his
art undoubtedly, but none to the memory of a dead man, and none
to the peace of a living one.&nbsp; But with him who would paint
the portrait of Browning or Rossetti how different is the
case!&nbsp; Although he requires the poet&rsquo;s vision before
he can paint a living picture of his subject, the task he has set
himself to do is something more than artistic: before everything
else it is fiduciary.</p>
<p>A trustee whose trust fund is biographical truth, he has,
after collecting and marshalling all the facts that come to his
hand, to decide what is truth as indicated by those generalized
facts.&nbsp; But having done this, he has to decide what is the
proper time for giving the world the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth&mdash;what is the proper time?&nbsp; In the
biographer&rsquo;s relation to the dead man on the one-hand and
to the public on the other should he be so unhappy as to forget
that time is of the very &ldquo;essence of the
contract&rdquo;&mdash;should he forget that so inwoven is human
life that truth spoken at the wrong moment may be a greater
mischief-worker than error&mdash;he may, if conscientious, have
to remember that forgetfulness of his during the remainder of his
days.&nbsp; He who thinks that truth may not be sometimes as
mischievous as a pestilence knows but little of this mysterious
and wonderful net of human life.&nbsp; But if this is so with
regard to truth, how much more is it so with regard to mere
matter <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of fact?&nbsp; Fact-worship,
document-worship, is at once the crowning folly and the crowning
vice of our time.&nbsp; To mistake a fact for a truth, and to
give the world that; to throw facts about and documents about
heedless of the mischief they may work&mdash;wronging the dead
and wronging the living&mdash;this is actually paraded as a
virtue in these days.</p>
<p>Here is a case in point.&nbsp; Down to the very last moment of
his life Rossetti&rsquo;s feeling towards his great contemporary
Tennyson was that of the deepest admiration, and yet what says
the documentary evidence as given to the world by
Rossetti&rsquo;s brother?&nbsp; It shows that Rossetti used an
extremely unpleasant phrase concerning a letter from Tennyson
acknowledging the receipt of Rossetti&rsquo;s first volume of
poems in 1870.&nbsp; Those who have heard Tennyson speak of
Rossetti know that to use this phrase in relation to any letter
of his dealing with Rossetti&rsquo;s poetry was to misunderstand
it.&nbsp; Yet here are the unpleasant words of a hasty mood,
&ldquo;rather shabby,&rdquo; in print.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Because the public has become so demoralized that its feast of
facts, its feast of documents it must have, come what will.&nbsp;
But even supposing that the public had any rights whatsoever in
regard to a man of genius, which we deny, what are letters as
indications of a man&rsquo;s character?&nbsp; Of all modes of
expression is not the epistolary mode that in which man&rsquo;s
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>instinct for using language &ldquo;to disguise his
thought&rdquo; is most likely to exercise itself?&nbsp; There is
likely to be far more deep sincerity in a sonnet than in a
letter.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to say that the common
courtesies of life demand a certain amount of what is called
&ldquo;blarney&rdquo; in a letter&mdash;especially in an eminent
man&rsquo;s letter&mdash;which would ruin a sonnet.&nbsp; And
this must be steadily borne in mind at a time like ours, when
private letters are bought and sold like any other article of
merchandise, not only immediately after a man&rsquo;s death, but
during his lifetime.</p>
<p>With regard to literary men, their letters in former times
were simply artistic compositions; hence as indications of
character they must be judged by the same canons as literary
essays would be judged.&nbsp; In both cases the writer had full
space and full time to qualify his statements of opinion; in both
cases he was without excuse for throwing out anything
heedlessly.&nbsp; Not only in Walpole&rsquo;s case and
Gray&rsquo;s, but also in Charles Lamb&rsquo;s, we apply the same
rules of criticism to the letters as we apply to the published
utterances that appeared in the writer&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp;
But now, when letters are just the hurried expression of the
moment, when ill-considered things&mdash;often rash
things&mdash;are said which either in literary compositions or in
conversation would have been, if said at all, greatly
qualified&mdash;the greatest injustice that <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>can be done
to a writer is to print his letters indiscriminately.&nbsp;
Especially is this the case with Rossetti.&nbsp; All who knew him
speak of him as being a superb critic, and a superb critic he
was.&nbsp; But his printed letters show nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; On literary subjects they are often full of
over-statement and of biased judgment.&nbsp; Here is the
explanation: in conversation he had a way of perpetrating a
brilliant critical paradox for the very purpose of qualifying it,
turning it about, colouring it by the lights of his wonderful
fancy, until at last it became something quite different from the
original paradox, and full of truth and wisdom.&nbsp; But when
such a paradox went off in a letter, there it remained
unqualified; and they who, not having known him, scoff at his
friends who claim for him the honours of a great critic, seem to
scoff with reason.</p>
<p>No one was more conscious of the treachery of letters than was
Rossetti himself.&nbsp; Comparatively late in his life he
realized what all eminent men would do well to realize, that
owing to the degradation of public taste, which cries out for
more personal gossip and still more every day, the time has fully
come when every man of mark must consider the rights of his
friends&mdash;when it behoves every man who has had the
misfortune to pass into fame to burn all letters; and he began
the holocaust that duty to friendship demanded of him.&nbsp; But
the <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>work of reading through such a correspondence as his in
order to see what letters must be preserved from the burning took
more time and more patience than he had contemplated, and the
destruction did not progress further than to include the letters
of the early sixties.&nbsp; Business letters it was, of course,
necessary to preserve, and very properly it is from these that
Mr. W. M. Rossetti has mainly quoted.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into two parts: first, documents
relating to the production of certain of Rossetti&rsquo;s
pictures and poems; and second, a prose paraphrase of &lsquo;The
House of Life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The documents consist of abstracts of and extracts from such
portions of Rossetti&rsquo;s correspondence as have fallen into
his brother&rsquo;s hands as executor.&nbsp; Dealing as they
necessarily do with those complications of prices and those
involved commissions for which Rossetti&rsquo;s artistic career
was remarkable, there is a commercial air about the first portion
of the book which some will think out of harmony with their
conception of the painter, about whom there used to be such a
mysterious interest until much writing about him had brought him
into the light of common day.&nbsp; In future years a summary so
accurate and so judicious as this will seem better worth making
than it, perhaps, seems at the present moment; for Mr. W. M.
Rossetti&rsquo;s love of facts is accompanied by an equally
strong love of making an honest statement <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>of
facts&mdash;a tabulated statement, if possible; and no one
writing of Rossetti need hesitate about following his brother to
the last letter and to the last figure.</p>
<p>To be precise and perspicuous is, he hints in his preface,
better than to be graphic and entertaining; and we entirely agree
with him, especially when the subject discussed is Rossetti,
about whom so many fancies that are neither precise nor
perspicuous are current.&nbsp; Still, to read about this picture
being offered to one buyer and that to another, and rejected or
accepted at a greatly reduced price after much chaffering, is
not, we will confess, exhilarating reading to those to whom
Rossetti&rsquo;s pictures are also poems.&nbsp; It does not
conduce to the happiness of his admirers to think of such works
being produced under such prosaic conditions.&nbsp; One
buyer&mdash;a most worthy man, to be sure, and a true friend of
Rossetti&rsquo;s, but full of that British superstition about the
saving grace of clothes which is so wonderful a revelation to the
pensive foreigner&mdash;had to be humoured in his craze against
the nude.&nbsp; After having painted a beautiful partly-draped
Gretchen (which, we may remark in passing, had no relation, as
Mr. W. M. Rossetti supposes, to the Marguerite alluded to in a
letter to Mr. Graham in 1870) from a new model whose
characteristics were a superb bosom and arms, he, Rossetti, was
obliged to consent to conceal the best portions of the picture
under drapery.</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>That this was a matter of great and peculiar vexation to
him may be supposed when it is remembered that unequalled as had
been his good fortune in finding fine face-models (ladies of
position and culture, and often of extraordinary beauty), he had
in the matter of figure-models been most unlucky.&nbsp; And this,
added to his slight knowledge of anatomy, made all his nude
pictures undesirable save those few painted from the beautiful
girl who stood for &lsquo;The Spirit of the Rainbow&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Forced Music.&rsquo;&nbsp; What his work from the nude
suffered from this is incalculable, as may be seen in the crayon
called &lsquo;Ligeia Siren,&rsquo; a naked siren playing on a
kind of lute, which Rossetti described as &ldquo;certainly one of
his best things.&rdquo;&nbsp; The beauty and value of a crayon
which for weird poetry&mdash;especially in the eyes&mdash;must be
among Rossetti&rsquo;s masterpieces are ruined by the drawing of
the breasts.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the book, however, is not that
which deals with the prices Rossetti got for his pictures, but
that which tells the reader the place where and the conditions
under which they were painted; and no portion of the book is more
interesting than that which relates to the work done at
Kelmscott:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the beginning of this year 1874 Rossetti
was again occupied with the picture which he had commenced in the
preceding spring, entitled, <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>&lsquo;The
Bower Maiden&rsquo;&mdash;a girl in a room with a pot of
marigolds and a black cat.&nbsp; It was painted from
&lsquo;little Annie&rsquo; (a cottage-girl and house assistant at
Kelmscott), and it &lsquo;goes on&rsquo; (to quote the words of
one of his letters) &lsquo;like a house on fire.&nbsp; This is
the only kind of picture one ought to do&mdash;just copying the
materials, and no more: all others are too much
trouble.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not difficult to understand that the
painter of a &lsquo;Proserpine&rsquo; and a
&lsquo;Ghirlandata&rsquo; would occasionally feel the luxury of a
mood intellectually lazy, and would be minded to give voice to
it&mdash;as in this instance&mdash;in terms wilfully extreme;
keeping his mental eye none the less steadily directed to a
&lsquo;Roman Widow&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Blessed Damozel&rsquo; in
the near future.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, my brother painted
very few things, at any stage of his career, as mere
representations of reality, unimbued by some inventive or ideal
meaning: in the rare instances when he did so, he naturally felt
an indolent comfort, and made no scruple of putting the feeling
into words&mdash;highly suitable for being taken <i>cum grano
salis</i>.&nbsp; Nothing was more alien from his nature or habit
than &lsquo;tall talk&rsquo; of any kind about his aims,
aspirations, or performances.&nbsp; It was into his
work&mdash;not into his utterances about his work&mdash;that he
infused the higher and deeper elements of his spirit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Bower Maiden&rsquo; was finished early in February,
and sold to Mr. Graham for 682<i>l.</i>, after it had been
offered to Mr. Leyland at a rather higher figure, and
declined.&nbsp; It has also passed under the names of
&lsquo;Fleurs de Marie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Marigolds,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
&lsquo;The Bower Maiden&rsquo; had <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>been disposed
of, other work was taken up&mdash;more especially &lsquo;The
Roman Widow,&rsquo; bearing the alternative title of
&lsquo;D&icirc;s Manibus,&rsquo; which was in an advanced stage
by the month of May, and was completed in June or July.&nbsp; It
was finished with little or no glazing.&nbsp; The Roman widow is
a lady still youthful, in a grey fawn-tinted drapery, with a
musical instrument in each hand; she is in the sepulchral chamber
of her husband, whose stone urn appears in the background.&nbsp;
I possess the antique urn which my brother procured, and which he
used for the painting.&nbsp; For graceful simplicity, and for
depth of earnest but not strained sentiment, he never, I think,
exceeded &lsquo;The Roman Widow.&rsquo;&nbsp; The two instruments
seem to repeat the two mottoes on the urn, &lsquo;Ave
Domine&mdash;Vale Domine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The head was painted from
Miss Wilding, already mentioned; but it seems to me partly
associated with the type of Mrs. Stillman&rsquo;s face as
well.&nbsp; There are many roses in this picture&mdash;both wild
and garden roses; they kept the artist waiting a little after the
work was otherwise finished.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really think it looks
well,&rsquo; he wrote on one occasion; &lsquo;its fair luminous
colour seems to melt into the gold frame (which has only just
come) like a part of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He feared that the picture
might be &lsquo;too severe and tragic&rsquo; for some tastes; but
could add (not, perhaps, with undue confidence), &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think G&eacute;ricault or R&eacute;gnault would have
quite scorned it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magnificent design here alluded to, &lsquo;D&icirc;s
Manibus,&rsquo; entirely suggested by the urn, which had somewhat
come into his possession (probably <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>through
Howell), and also &lsquo;The Bower Maiden,&rsquo; suggested by
his accidentally seeing a pretty cottage-child lifting some
marigolds to a shelf, formed part of the superb work produced by
Rossetti during his long retirement at Kelmscott Manor&mdash;that
period never before recorded, which has at this very moment been
brought into prominence by his friend Dr. Hake&rsquo;s
sonnet-sequence &lsquo;The New Day,&rsquo; just published.&nbsp;
As far as literary and artistic work goes, it was, perhaps, the
richest period of his life; and that it was also one of the
happiest is clear not only from his own words, but also from the
following testimony of Dr. Hake, who saw much of him
there:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O, happy days with him who once so loved us!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We loved as brothers, with a single heart,<br />
The man whose iris-woven pictures moved us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From nature to her blazoned shadow&mdash;Art.<br />
How often did we trace the nestling Thames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From humblest waters on his course of might,<br />
Down where the weir the bursting current stems&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There sat till evening grew to balmy night,<br />
Veiling the weir whose roar recalled the Strand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we had listened to the wave-lipped sea,<br />
That seemed to utter plaudits while we planned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphal labours of the day to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was at Kelmscott, in the famous tapestried room, that
besides painting the &lsquo;Proserpine,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Roman
Widow,&rsquo; &amp;c., he wrote many of his later poems,
including &lsquo;Rose Mary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Considering how deep is Mr. W. M. Rossetti&rsquo;s affection
for his brother&rsquo;s memory, and how great is his admiration
for his brother&rsquo;s work, <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>it is
remarkable how judicial is his mind when writing about him.&nbsp;
This is what he says about the much discussed &lsquo;Venus
Astarte&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Into the &lsquo;Venus Astarte&rsquo; he had
put his utmost intensity of thinking, feeling, and
method&mdash;he had aimed to make it equally strong in abstract
sentiment and in physical grandeur&mdash;an ideal of the mystery
of beauty, offering a sort of combined quintessence of what he
had endeavoured in earlier years to embody in the two several
types of &lsquo;Sibylla Palmifera&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Lilith,&rsquo; or (as he ultimately named them in the
respective sonnets) &lsquo;Soul&rsquo;s Beauty&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Body&rsquo;s Beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be well to remark
that, by the time when he completed the &lsquo;Venus
Astarte,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Astarte Syriaca,&rsquo; he had got into
a more austere feeling than of old with regard to colour and
chiaroscuro; and the charm of the picture has, I am aware, been
less, to many critics and spectators of the work, than he would
have deemed to be its due, as compared with some of his other
performances of more obvious and ostensible
attraction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though Mr. W. M. Rossetti is right in saying that it was not
till the beginning of 1877 that this remarkable picture was
brought to a conclusion, the main portions were done during that
long sojourn at Bognor in 1876&ndash;7, which those who have
written about Rossetti have hitherto left unrecorded.&nbsp;
Having fallen into ill health after his return to London from
Kelmscott, he was advised to go to the seaside, and a large house
at Bognor was finally selected.&nbsp; <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>No doubt one
reason why the preference was given to Bognor was the fact that
Blake&rsquo;s cottage at Felpham was close by, for businesslike
and unbusiness-like qualities were strangely mingled in
Rossetti&rsquo;s temperament, and it was generally some sentiment
or unpractical fancy of this kind that brought about
Rossetti&rsquo;s final decision upon anything.&nbsp;
Blake&rsquo;s name was with him still a word to charm with, and
he was surprised to find, on the first pilgrimage of himself and
his friends to the cottage, that scarcely a person in the
neighbourhood knew what Blake it was that &ldquo;the
Londoners&rdquo; were inquiring about.</p>
<p>To the secluded house at Bognor&mdash;a house so surrounded by
trees and shrubs that the murmur of the waves mingling with the
whispers of the leaves seemed at one moment the sea&rsquo;s
voice, and at another the voice of the earth&mdash;Rossetti took
not only the cartoon of the &lsquo;Astarte Syriaca,&rsquo; but
also the most peculiar of all his pictures, &lsquo;The Blessed
Damozel,&rsquo; which had long lain in an incomplete state.&nbsp;
But it was not much painting that he did at Bognor.&nbsp; From a
cause he tried in vain to understand, and tried in vain to
conquer, his thoughts ran upon poetry, and refused to fix
themselves upon art.&nbsp; Partly this might have been owing to
the fact that now, comparatively late in life, he to whom, as his
brother well says, &ldquo;such words as <i>sea</i>, <i>ship</i>,
and <i>boat</i> were <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>generic terms admitting of little
specific and still less of any individual and detailed
distinction,&rdquo; awoke to the fascination that the sea sooner
or later exercises upon all truly romantic souls.&nbsp; For deep
as is the poetry of the inland woods, the Spirit of Romance, if
there at all, is there in hiding.&nbsp; In order for that Spirit
to come forth and take captive the soul something else is wanted;
howsoever thick and green the trees&mdash;howsoever bright and
winding the streams&mdash;a magical glimmer of sea-light far or
near must shine through the branches as they wave.</p>
<p>That this should be a new experience to so fine a poet as
Rossetti was no doubt strange, but so it chanced to be.&nbsp; He
whose talk at Kelmscott had been of &lsquo;Blessed
Damozels&rsquo; and &lsquo;Roman Widows&rsquo; and the like,
talked now of the wanderings of Ulysses, of &lsquo;The Ancient
Mariner,&rsquo; of &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens,&rsquo; and even of
&lsquo;Arthur Gordon Pym&rsquo; and &lsquo;Allan
Gordon.&rsquo;&nbsp; And on hearing a friend recite some
tentative verses on a great naval battle, he looked about for sea
subjects too; and it was now, and not later, as is generally
supposed, that he really thought of the subject of &lsquo;The
White Ship,&rsquo; a subject apparently so alien from his
genius.&nbsp; Every evening he used to take walks on the beach
for miles and miles, delighted with a beauty that before had had
no charms for him.&nbsp; Still, the &lsquo;Astarte Syriaca&rsquo;
did progress, <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>though slowly, and became the
masterpiece that Mr. W. M. Rossetti sets so high among his
brother&rsquo;s work.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From Bognor my brother returned to his
house in Cheyne Walk; and in the summer he paid a visit to two of
his kindest and most considerate friends, Lord and Lady
Mount-Temple, at their seat of Broadlands in Hampshire.&nbsp; He
executed there a portrait in chalks of Lady Mount-Temple.&nbsp;
He went on also with the picture of &lsquo;The Blessed
Damozel.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the head of an infant angel which
appears in the front of this picture he made drawings from two
children&mdash;one being the baby of the Rev. H. C. Hawtrey, and
the other a workhouse infant.&nbsp; The former sketch was
presented to the parents of the child and the latter to Lady
Mount-Temple; and the head with its wings, was painted on to the
canvas at Broadlands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. W. M. Rossetti omits to mention that the landscape which
forms the predella to &lsquo;The Blessed Damozel,&rsquo; a river
winding in a peculiarly tortuous course through the cedars and
other wide-spread trees of an English park, was taken from the
scenery of Broadlands&mdash;that fairyland of soft beauty which
lived in his memory as it must needs live in the memory of every
one who has once known it.&nbsp; But the wonder is that such a
mass of solid material has been compressed into so small a
space.</p>
<p>Mr. W. M. Rossetti&rsquo;s paraphrase of &lsquo;The House of
Life&rsquo;&mdash;done with so much admiration <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>of his
brother&rsquo;s genius and affection for his memory&mdash;touches
upon a question relating to poetic art which has been raised
before&mdash;raised in connexion with prose renderings of Homer,
Sophocles, and Dante: Are poetry and prose so closely related in
method that one can ever be adequately turned into the
other?&nbsp; Schiller no doubt wrote his dramas in prose and then
turned them into rhetorical verse; but then there are those who
affirm that Schiller&rsquo;s rhetorical verse is scarcely
poetry.&nbsp; The importance of the question will be seen when we
call to mind that if such a transmutation of form were possible,
translations of poetry would be possible; for though, owing to
the tyrannous demands of form, the verse of one language can
never be translated into the verse of another, it can always be
rendered in the prose of another, only it then ceases to be
poetry.</p>
<p>That the intellectual, and even to some extent the emotional,
substance of a poem can be seized and covered by a prose
translation is seen in Prof. Jebb&rsquo;s rendering of the
&lsquo;&OElig;dipus Rex&rsquo;; but, as we have before remarked,
the fundamental difference between imaginative prose and poetry
is that, while the one must be informed with intellectual life
and emotional life, the other has to be informed with both these
kinds of life, and with another life beyond these&mdash;rhythmic
life.&nbsp; Now, if we wished to show that rhythmic life is in
poetry the most <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>important of all, our example would,
we think, be Mr. W. M. Rossetti&rsquo;s prose paraphrase of his
brother&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp; The obstacles against the adequate
turning of poetry into prose can be best understood by
considering the obstacles against the adequate turning of prose
into poetry.&nbsp; Prose notes tracing out the course of the
future poem may, no doubt, be made, and usefully made, by the
poet (as Wordsworth said in an admirable letter to Gillies),
unless, indeed, the notes form too elaborate an attempt at a full
prose expression of the subject-matter, in which case, so soon as
the poet tries to rise on his winged words, his wingless words
are likely to act as a dead weight.&nbsp; For this reason, when
Wordsworth said that the prose notes should be brief, he might
almost as well have gone on to say that in expression they should
be slovenly.&nbsp; This at least may be said, that the moment the
language of the prose note is so &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and rich
that it seems to be what Wordsworth would call the natural
&ldquo;incarnation of the thought,&rdquo; the poet&rsquo;s
imagination, if it escapes at all from the chains of the prose
expression, escapes with great difficulty.&nbsp; An instance of
this occurred in Rossetti&rsquo;s own experience.</p>
<p>During one of those seaside rambles alluded to above, while he
was watching with some friends the billows tumbling in beneath
the wintry moon, some one, perhaps Rossetti <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>himself,
directed attention to the peculiar effect of the moon&rsquo;s
disc reflected in the white surf, and compared it to fire in
snow.&nbsp; Rossetti, struck with the picturesqueness of the
comparison, made there and then an elaborate prose note of it in
one of the diminutive pocket-books that he was in the habit of
carrying in the capacious pocket of his waistcoat.&nbsp; Years
afterwards&mdash;shortly before his death, in fact&mdash;when he
came to write &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s Tragedy,&rsquo; remembering
this note, he thought he could find an excellent place for it in
the scene where the king meets the Spae wife on the seashore and
listens to her prophecies of doom.&nbsp; But he was at once
confronted by this obstacle: so elaborately had the image of the
moon reflected in the surf been rendered in the prose
note&mdash;so entirely did the prose matter seem to be the
inevitable and the final incarnation of the thought&mdash;that it
appeared impossible to escape from it into the movement and the
diction proper to poetry.&nbsp; It was only after much
labour&mdash;a labour greater than he had given to all the
previous stanzas combined&mdash;that he succeeded in freeing
himself from the fetters of the prose, and in painting the
picture in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That eve was clenched for a boding storm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath a toilsome moon half seen;<br />
The cloud stooped low and the surf rose high;<br />
And where there was a line of sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild wings loomed dark between.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&rsquo;Twas then the moon sailed clear of the rack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On high on her hollow dome;<br />
And still as aloft with hoary crest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each clamorous wave rang home,<br />
Like fire in snow the moonlight blazed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the champing foam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the remark was then made to him with regard to
Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wanderings of Cain,&rsquo; that it is
not unlikely the matchless fragment given in Coleridge&rsquo;s
poems might have passed nearer towards completion, or at least
towards the completion of the first part, had it not been for
those elaborate and beautiful prose notes which he has left
behind.</p>
<p>And if the attempt to turn prose into poetry is hopeless, the
attempt to turn poetry into prose is no less so, and for a like
reason&mdash;that of the immense difficulty of passing from the
movement natural to one mood into the movement natural to
another.&nbsp; And this criticism applies especially to the
poetry of Rossetti, which produces so many of its best effects by
means not of logical statement, but of the music and suggestive
richness of rhythmical language.&nbsp; That Rossetti did on some
occasions, when told that his sonnets were unintelligible, talk
about making such a paraphrase himself is indisputable, because
Mr. Fairfax Murray say that he heard him say so.&nbsp; But
indisputable also is many another saying of Rossetti&rsquo;s,
equally ill-considered and equally impracticable.&nbsp; That he
ever seriously thought of doing so is most unlikely.</p>
<h3><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>III.</h3>
<p>In his memoir of his brother, Mr. William Michael Rossetti
thus makes mention of a ballad left by the poet which still
remains unpublished:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It [the ballad] is most fully worthy of
publication, but has not been included in Rossetti&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Collected Works,&rsquo; because he gave the MS. to his
devoted friend Mr. Theodore Watts, with whom alone now rests the
decision of presenting it or not to the public.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he afterwards mentions certain sonnets on the Sphinx, also
in my possession.</p>
<p>With the most generous intentions my dear and loyal friend
William Rossetti has here brought me into trouble.</p>
<p>Naturally such an announcement as the above has excited great
curiosity among admirers of Rossetti, and I am frequently
receiving letters&mdash;some of them cordial enough, but others
far from cordial&mdash;asking, or rather demanding, to know the
reason why important poems of Rossetti&rsquo;s have for so long a
period been withheld from the public.&nbsp; In order to explain
the delay I must first give two extracts from Mr. Hall
Caine&rsquo;s picturesque &lsquo;Recollections of
Rossetti,&rsquo; published in 1882:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The end was drawing near, and we all knew
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>the fact.&nbsp; Rossetti had actually taken to poetical
composition afresh, and had written a facetious ballad (conceived
years before), of the length of &lsquo;The White Ship,&rsquo;
called &lsquo;Jan Van Hunks,&rsquo; embodying an eccentric story
of a Dutchman&rsquo;s wager to smoke against the devil.&nbsp;
This was to appear in a miscellany of stories and poems by
himself and Mr. Theodore Watts, a project which had been a
favourite one of his for some years, and in which he now, in his
last moments, took a revived interest, strange and
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday morning, April 5th, I went into the
bedroom to which he had for some days been confined, and wrote
out to his dictation two sonnets which he had composed on a
design of his called &lsquo;The Sphinx,&rsquo; and which he
wished to give, together with the drawing and the ballad before
described, to Mr. Watts for publication in the volume just
mentioned.&nbsp; On the Thursday morning I found his utterance
thick, and his speech from that cause hardly
intelligible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the facts in connexion with this project exhibit, with a
force that not all the words of all his detractors can withstand,
the splendid generosity of the poet&rsquo;s nature, I only wish
that I had made them public years ago, Rossetti (whose power of
taking interest in a friend&rsquo;s work Mr. Joseph Knight has
commented upon) had for years been urging me to publish certain
writings of mine with which he was familiar, and for years I had
declined to do so&mdash;declined for two simple reasons: first,
though I liked <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>writing for its own
sake&mdash;indulged in it, indeed, as a delightful
luxury&mdash;to enter formally the literary arena, and to go
through that struggle which, as he himself used to say,
&ldquo;had never yet brought comfort to any poet, but only
sorrow,&rdquo; had never been an ambition of mine; and, secondly,
I was only too conscious how biased must the judgment be of a man
whose affections were so strong as his when brought to bear upon
the work of a friend.</p>
<p>In order at last to achieve an end upon which he had set his
heart, he proposed that he and I should jointly produce the
volume to which Mr. Hall Caine refers, and that he should enrich
it with reproductions of certain drawings of his, including the
&lsquo;Sphinx&rsquo; (now or lately in the possession of Mr.
William Rossetti) and crayons and pencil drawings in my own
possession illustrating poems of mine&mdash;those drawings, I
mean, from that new model chosen by me whose head Leighton said
must be the loveliest ever drawn, who sat for &lsquo;The Spirit
of the Rainbow,&rsquo; and that other design which William Sharp
christened &lsquo;Forced Music.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In order to conquer my most natural reluctance to see a name
so unknown as mine upon a title-page side by side with a name so
illustrious as his, he (or else it was his generous sister
Christina, I forget which) italianized the words Walter Theodore
Watts into &ldquo;Gualtiero Teodoro Gualtieri&rdquo;&mdash;a
name, I may add in <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>passing, which appears as an
inscription on one at least of the valuable Christmas presents he
made me, a rare old Venetian Boccaccio.&nbsp; My portion of the
book was already in existence, but that which was to have been
the main feature of the volume, a ballad of Rossetti&rsquo;s to
be called &lsquo;Michael Scott&rsquo;s Wooing&rsquo; (which had
no relation to early designs of his bearing that name), hung fire
for this reason: the story upon which the ballad was to have been
based was discovered to be not an old legend adapted and varied
by the Romanies, as I had supposed when I gave it to him, but
simply the Ettrick Shepherd&rsquo;s novelette &lsquo;Mary
Burnet&rsquo;; and the project then rested in abeyance until that
last illness at Birchington painted so graphically and
pathetically by Mr. Hall Caine.</p>
<p>For some reason quite inscrutable to the late John Marshall,
who attended him, and to all of us, this old idea seized upon his
brain; so much so, indeed, that Marshall hailed it as a good
omen, and advised us to foster it, which we did with excellent
results, as will be seen by referring to the very last entry in
his mother&rsquo;s touching diary as lately printed by Mr. W. M.
Rossetti: &ldquo;March 28, Tuesday.&nbsp; Mr. Watts came
down.&nbsp; Gabriel rallied marvellously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the ballad, in Rossetti&rsquo;s own writing, has ever
since remained in my possession, as have also the two sonnets in
the MS. of another friend who has since, I am delighted to know,
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>achieved fame for himself, no one who enjoyed the
intimate friendship of Rossetti need be told that his death took
from me all heart to publish.</p>
<p>Time, however, is the suzerain before whom every king, even
Sorrow himself, bows at last.&nbsp; The rights of
Rossetti&rsquo;s admirers can no longer be set at nought, and I
am making arrangements to publish within the present year
&lsquo;Jan Van Hunks&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Sphinx Sonnets,&rsquo;
the former of which will show a new and, I think, unexpected side
of Rossetti&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<h3><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>IV.</h3>
<p>It is a sweet and comforting thought for every poet that,
whether or not the public cares during his life to read his
verses, it will after his death care very much to read his
letters to his mistress, to his wife, to his relatives, to his
friends, to his butcher, and to his baker.&nbsp; And some letters
are by that same public held to be more precious than
others.&nbsp; If, for instance, it has chanced that during the
poet&rsquo;s life he, like Rossetti, had to borrow thirty
shillings from a friend, that is a circumstance of especial
piquancy.&nbsp; The public likes&mdash;or rather it
demands&mdash;to know all about that borrowed cash.&nbsp; Hence
it behoves the properly equipped editor who understands his duty
to see that not one allusion to it in the poet&rsquo;s
correspondence is omitted.&nbsp; If he can also show what caused
the poet to borrow those thirty shillings&mdash;if he can by
learned annotations show whether the friend in question lent the
sum willingly or unwillingly, conveniently or
inconveniently&mdash;if he can show whether the loan was ever
repaid, and if repaid when&mdash;he will be a happy editor
indeed.&nbsp; Then he will find a large and a grateful public to
whom the mood in which the poet sat down to write <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&lsquo;The Blessed Damosel&rsquo; is of far less
interest than the mood in which he borrowed thirty shillings.</p>
<p>We do not charge the editor of this volume <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> with exhibiting unusual want of
taste.&nbsp; On the whole, he is less irritating to the poetical
student than those who have laboured in kindred &ldquo;fields of
literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, we do not so much blame the
editors of such books as we blame the public, whose coarse and
vulgar mouth is always agape for such pabulum.&nbsp; The writer
of this review possesses an old circulating-library copy of a
book containing some letters of Coleridge.&nbsp; One page, and
one only, is greatly disfigured by thumb marks.&nbsp; It is the
page on which appears, not some precious hint as to the
conclusion of &lsquo;Christabel,&rsquo; but a domestic missive of
Coleridge&rsquo;s ordering broad beans for dinner.</p>
<p>If, then, the name of those readers who take an interest in
broad beans is legion compared with the name of those who take an
interest in &lsquo;Kubla Khan,&rsquo; is not the wise editor he
who gives all due attention to the poet&rsquo;s favourite
vegetable?&nbsp; Those who will read with avidity
Rossetti&rsquo;s allusion to his wife&rsquo;s confinement in the
letter in which he tells Allingham that &ldquo;the child had been
dead for two or <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>three weeks&rdquo; will laugh to
scorn the above remarks, and as they are in the majority the
laugh is with them.</p>
<p>The editor of this volume laments that Allingham&rsquo;s
letters to Rossetti are beyond all editorial reach.&nbsp; But who
has any right to ask for Allingham&rsquo;s private letters?&nbsp;
Rossetti, who was strongly against the printing of private
letters, had the wholesome practice of burning all his
correspondence.&nbsp; This he did at periodical
holocausts&mdash;memorable occasions when the coruscations of the
poet&rsquo;s wit made the sparks from the burning paper seem pale
and dull.&nbsp; He died away from home, or not a scrap of
correspondence would have been left for the publishers.&nbsp;
Although the &ldquo;public&rdquo; acknowledges no duties towards
the man of literary or artistic genius, but would shrug up its
shoulders or look with dismay at being asked to give five pounds
in order to keep a poet from the workhouse, the moment a man of
genius becomes famous the public becomes aware of certain rights
in relation to him.&nbsp; Strangely enough, these rights are
recognized more fully in the literary arena than anywhere else,
and among them the chief appears to be that of reading an
author&rsquo;s private letters.&nbsp; One advantage&mdash;and
surely it is a very great one&mdash;that the &ldquo;writing
man&rdquo; has over the man of action is this: that, while the
portrait of the man of action has to be painted, if painted at
all, by <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the biographer, the writing man
paints his own portrait for himself.</p>
<p>And as, in a deep sense, every biographer is an inventor like
the novelist&mdash;as from the few facts that he is able to
collect he infers a character&mdash;the man of action, after he
is dead, is at the mercy of every man who writes his life.&nbsp;
Is not Alexander the Great no less a figment of another
man&rsquo;s brain than Achilles, or Macbeth, or Mr.
Pickwick?&nbsp; But a poet, howsoever artistic, howsoever
dramatic, the form of his work may be, is occupied during his
entire life in painting his own portrait.&nbsp; And if it were
not for the intervention of the biographer, the reminiscence
writer, or the collector of letters for publication, our
conception of every poet would be true and vital according to the
intelligence with which we read his work.</p>
<p>This is why, of all English poets, Shakespeare is the only one
whom we do thoroughly know&mdash;unless perhaps we should except
his two great contemporaries Webster and Marlowe.&nbsp; Steevens
did not exaggerate when he said that all we know of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s outer life is that he was born at
Stratford-on-Avon, married, went to London, wrote plays, returned
to Stratford, and died.&nbsp; Owing to this circumstance (and a
blessed one it is) we can commune with the greatest of our poets
undisturbed.&nbsp; We know how Shakespeare confronted every
circumstance of this mysterious life&mdash;we know how he
confronted <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the universe, seen and
unseen&mdash;we know to what degree and in what way he felt every
human passion.&nbsp; There is no careless letter of his, thank
God! to give us a wrong impression of him.&nbsp; There is no
record of his talk at the Mermaid, the Falcon, or the Apollo
saloon to make readers doubtful whether his printed utterances
truly represent him.&nbsp; Would that the will had been
destroyed! then there would have been no talk about the
&ldquo;second-best bed&rdquo; and the like insane gabble.&nbsp;
Suppose, by ill chance, a batch of his letters to Anna Hathaway
had been preserved.&nbsp; Is it not a moral certainty that they
would have been as uninteresting as the letters of Coleridge, of
Scott, of Dickens, of Rossetti, and of Rossetti&rsquo;s
sister?</p>
<p>Why are the letters of literary men apt to be so much less
interesting than those of other people?&nbsp; Is it not because,
the desire to express oneself in written language being
universal, this desire with people outside the literary class has
to be of necessity exercised in letter-writing?&nbsp; Is it not
because, where there is no other means of written expression than
that of letter-writing, the best efforts of the letter-writer are
put into the composition, as the best writing of the essayist is
put into his essays?&nbsp; However this might have been in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, the half-conscious, graphic power of
the non-literary letter-writer of to-day is often so <!-- page
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>great that if all the letters written in English by
non-literary people, especially letters written from abroad to
friends at home in the year 1897, <a name="citation108"></a><a
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a> were collected,
and the cream of them extracted and printed, the book would be
the most precious literary production that the year has to
show.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the letters of contemporary
English authors were collected in the same way, the poverty of
the book would be amazing as compared with the published writings
of the authors.&nbsp; With regard to Dickens&rsquo;s letters,
indeed, the contrast between their commonplace, colourless style
and the pregnancy of his printed utterances makes the writing in
his books seem forced, artificial, unnatural.</p>
<p>The same may in some degree be said of such letters of
Rossetti as have hitherto been published.&nbsp; The charming
family letters printed by his brother come, of course, under a
different category.&nbsp; With the exception of these, perhaps
the letters in the volume before us are the most interesting
Rossetti letters that have been printed.&nbsp; Yet it is
astonishing how feeble they are in giving the reader an idea of
Rossetti himself.&nbsp; And this gives birth to the question: Do
we not live at a time when the unfairness of printing an
author&rsquo;s letters is greater than it ever was before?&nbsp;
To go no further back than the early years of the present
century, the <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>facilities of locomotion were then
few, friends were necessarily separated from each other by long
intervals of time, and letters were a very important part of
intercommunication, consequently it might be expected that even
among authors a good deal of a man&rsquo;s individuality would be
expressed in his letters.&nbsp; But even at that period it was
only a quite exceptional nature like that of Charles Lamb which
adequately expressed itself in epistolary form.&nbsp;
Keats&rsquo;s letters, no doubt, are full of good sense and good
criticism, but taking them as a body, including the letters to
Fanny Brawne, we think it were better if they had been totally
destroyed.&nbsp; As to Byron&rsquo;s letters, they, of course,
are admirable in style and full of literary life, but their very
excellence shows that his natural mode of expression was
brilliant, slashing prose.&nbsp; But if it was unfair to publish
the letters of Coleridge and Keats, what shall we say of the
publication of letters written by the authors of our own day,
when, owing to an entire change in the conditions of life, no one
dreams of putting into his letters anything of literary
interest?</p>
<p>When Rossetti died he was, as regards the public, owing to his
exclusiveness, much in the same position as Shakespeare has
always been.&nbsp; The picture of Rossetti that lived in the
public mind was that of a poet and painter of extraordinary
imaginative intensity and magic, whose <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>personality, as romantic as his work, influenced all
who came in contact with him.&nbsp; He was, indeed, the only
romantic figure in the imagination of the literary and art world
of his time.&nbsp; It seemed as if in his very name there was an
unaccountable music.&nbsp; The present writer well remembers
being at a dinner-party many years ago when the late Lord
Leighton was talking in his usual delightful way.&nbsp; His
conversation was specially attended to only by his interlocutor,
until the name of Rossetti fell from his lips.&nbsp; Then the
general murmur of tongues ceased.&nbsp; Everybody wanted to hear
what was being said about the mysterious poet-painter.&nbsp; Thus
matters stood when Rossetti died.&nbsp; Within forty-eight hours
of his death the many-headed beast clamoured for its
rights.&nbsp; Within forty-eight hours of his death there was a
leading article in an important newspaper on the subject of his
suspiciousness as the result of chloral-drinking.&nbsp; And from
that moment the romance has been rubbed off the picture as
effectually by many of those who have written about him as the
bloom is fingered off of a clumsily gathered peach.</p>
<p>But the reader will say, &ldquo;Truth is great, and must
prevail.&nbsp; The picture of Rossetti that now exists in the
public mind is the true one.&nbsp; The former picture was a
lie.&rdquo;&nbsp; But here the reader will be much
mistaken.&nbsp; The romantic picture which existed in the public
mind during Rossetti&rsquo;s <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>life was
the true one; the picture that now exists of him is false.</p>
<p>Does any one want to know what kind of a man was the painter
of &lsquo;Dante&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; and the poet of &lsquo;The
Blessed Damosel,&rsquo; let him wipe out of his mind most of what
has been written about him, let him forget if he can most of the
Rossetti letters that have been published, and let him read the
poet&rsquo;s poems and study the painter&rsquo;s pictures, and he
will know Rossetti&mdash;not, indeed, so thoroughly as we know
Shakespeare and &AElig;schylus and Sophocles, but as intimately
as it is possible to know any man whose biography is written only
in his works.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that for those who had a
personal knowledge of Rossetti some of the letters in this volume
will have an interest, owing to the evidence they afford of that
authorial generosity which was one of his most beautiful
characteristics.&nbsp; His disinterested appreciation of the work
of his contemporaries sets him apart from all the other poets of
his time and perhaps of any other time.&nbsp; To wax eloquent in
praise of this and that illustrious name, and thus to claim a
kind of kinship with it, is a very different thing from
Rossetti&rsquo;s noble championship of a name, whether that of a
friend or otherwise, which has never emerged from
obscurity.&nbsp; It is perhaps inevitable and in the nature of
things that most poets are too much absorbed in their own work to
have time <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>to interest themselves in the doings
of their fellow-workers.</p>
<p>But, with regard to Rossetti, he could feel, and often did
feel, as deep an interest in the work of another man as in his
own.&nbsp; There was no trouble he would not take to aid a friend
in gaining recognition.&nbsp; This it was more than anything else
which endeared him to all his friends, and made them condone
those faults of his which ever since his death have been so
freely discussed.&nbsp; The editor of this volume quotes this
sentence from Skelton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Table-Talk of
Shirley&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have preserved a number of
Rossetti&rsquo;s letters, and there is barely one, I think, which
is not mainly devoted to warm commendation of obscure poets and
painters&mdash;obscure at the time of writing, but of whom more
than one has since become famous.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor was his interest in other men&rsquo;s work confined to
that of his personal friends.&nbsp; His discovery of
Browning&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pauline,&rsquo; of Charles Wells, and of
the poems of Ebenezer Jones may be cited as instances of
this.&nbsp; Moreover, he was always looking out in
magazines&mdash;some of them of the most obscure kind&mdash;for
good work.&nbsp; And if he was rewarded, as he sometimes was, by
coming upon precious things that might otherwise have been lost,
his heart was rejoiced.</p>
<p>One day, having turned into a coffee-house in Chancery Lane to
get a cup of coffee, he <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>came upon a
number of <i>Reynolds&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>, and finding there a
poem called &lsquo;A Lover&rsquo;s Pastime,&rsquo; he saw at once
its extraordinary beauty, and enclosed it in a letter to
Allingham.&nbsp; In this case, however, he unfortunately did not
make his usual efforts to discover the authorship of a poem that
pleased him; and a pity it is, for the poem is one of the
loveliest lyrics that have been written in modern times.&nbsp; We
hope it will find a place in the next anthology of lyrical
poetry.</p>
<p>Though his criticisms were not always sure and impeccable, he
was of all critics the most independent of authority.&nbsp; Had
he chanced to find in the poets&rsquo; corner of <i>The
Eatanswill Gazette</i> a lyric equal to the best of
Shelley&rsquo;s, he would have recognized its merits at once and
proclaimed them; and had he come across a lyric of
Shelley&rsquo;s that had received unmerited applause, he would
have recognized its demerits for himself, and proclaimed them
with equal candour and fearlessness.</p>
<p>Again, certain passages in these letters will surprise the
reader by throwing light upon a side of Rossetti&rsquo;s life and
character which was only known to his intimate friends.&nbsp;
Recluse as Rossetti came to be, he knew more of &ldquo;London
life&rdquo; in the true sense of the word than did many of those
who were supposed to know it well&mdash;diners-out like Browning,
for instance, <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>and Richard Doyle.&nbsp; That the
author of &lsquo;The House of Life&rsquo; knew London on the side
that Dickens knew it better than any other poet of his time will
no doubt surprise many a reader.&nbsp; His visits to
Jamrach&rsquo;s mart for wild animals led him to explore the
wonderful world, that so few people ever dream of, which lies
around Ratcliffe Highway.&nbsp; He observed with the greatest
zest the movements of the East-End swarm.&nbsp; Moreover, his
passion for picking up &ldquo;curios&rdquo; and antique furniture
made him familiar with quarters of London that he would otherwise
have never known.&nbsp; And not Dickens himself had more of what
may be called the &ldquo;Haroun al Raschid passion&rdquo; for
wandering through a city&rsquo;s streets at night.&nbsp; It was
this that kept him in touch on one side with men so unlike him as
Brough and Sala.</p>
<p>In this volume there is a charming anecdote of his generosity
to Brough&rsquo;s family, and Sala always spoke of him as
&ldquo;dear Dante Rossetti.&rdquo;&nbsp; The transpontine
theatre, even the penny gaff of the New Cut, was not quite
unfamiliar with the face of the poet-painter.&nbsp; Hence no man
was a better judge than he of the low-life pictures of a writer
like F. W. Robinson, whose descriptions of the street arab in
&lsquo;Owen, a Waif,&rsquo; &amp;c., he would read aloud with a
dramatic power astonishing to those who associated him
exclusively with Dante, Beatrice, and mystical passion.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Frequently in these letters an allusion will puzzle the
reader who does not know of Rossetti&rsquo;s love of nocturnal
rambling, an allusion, however, which those who knew him will
fully understand.&nbsp; Here is a sentence of the
kind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As I haven&rsquo;t been outside my door for
months in the daytime, I should not have had much opportunity of
enjoying pastime and pleasaunces.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor quotes some graphic and interesting words from Mr.
W. M. Rossetti which explain this passage.</p>
<p>In summer, as in winter, he rose very late in the day and made
a breakfast, as he used to say, which was to keep him in fuel for
something under twelve hours.&nbsp; He would then begin to paint,
and scarcely leave his work till the daylight waned.&nbsp; Then
he would dine, and afterwards start off for a walk through the
London streets, which to him, as he used to say, put on a magical
robe with the lighting of the gas lamps.&nbsp; After walking for
miles through the streets, either with a friend or alone,
loitering at the windows of such shops as still were open, he
would turn into an oyster shop or late restaurant for
supper.&nbsp; Here his frankness of bearing was quite
irresistible with strangers whenever it pleased him to approach
them, as he sometimes did.&nbsp; The most singular and bizarre
incidents of his life occurred to him on these
occasions&mdash;incidents which he would relate <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>with a dramatic power that set him at the head of the
<i>raconteurs</i> of his time.&nbsp; One of these
<i>rencontres</i> in the Haymarket was of a quite extraordinary
character.</p>
<p>In the latter years of his life, when he lived at Cheyne Walk,
he would often not begin his perambulations until an hour before
midnight.&nbsp; It will be a pity if some one who accompanied him
in his nocturnal rambles&mdash;the most remarkable man of our
time&mdash;does not furnish the world with reminiscences of
them.</p>
<p>Another point of interest upon which these letters will throw
light is that connected with his method of work.&nbsp; He
himself, like Tennyson, used to say that those who are the most
curious as to the way in which a poem was written are precisely
those who have the least appreciation of the beauties of the poem
itself.&nbsp; If this is true, the time in which we live is not
remarkable, perhaps, for its appreciation of poetry.&nbsp; These
letters, at any rate, will be appreciated, for the light that
some of them throw upon Rossetti at work is remarkable.&nbsp;
When a subject for a poem struck him, it was his way to make a
prose note of it, then to cartoon it, then to leave it for a
time, then to take it up again and read it to his friends, and
then to finish it.&nbsp; In a letter to Allingham, dated July
18th, 1854, enclosing the first form of the sonnet called
&lsquo;Lost on Both Sides&rsquo;&mdash;which sonnet did not
appear in print till 1881&mdash;<!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Rossetti
says: &ldquo;My sonnets are not generally finished till I see
them again after forgetting them; and this is only two days
old.&nbsp; When between the first form of a sonnet and the second
an interval of twenty-seven years elapses, no student of poetry
can fail to compare one form with the other.</p>
<p>And so with regard to that poem which is, on the whole,
Rossetti&rsquo;s masterpiece&mdash;&lsquo;Sister
Helen&rsquo;&mdash;sent as early as 1854 to Mrs. Howitt for the
German publication the <i>D&uuml;sseldorf Annual</i>; the changes
in it are extremely interesting.&nbsp; Never did it appear in
print without suffering some important variation.&nbsp;
Sometimes, indeed, the change of a word or two in a line would
entirely transfigure the stanza.&nbsp; As to the new stanzas
added to the ballad just before Rossetti&rsquo;s death, these
turned the ballad from a fine poem into a great one.</p>
<p>Equally striking are the changes in &lsquo;The Blessed
Damosel.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the most notable example of the surety
of his hand in revising is seen in regard to a poem several times
mentioned in this volume, called originally &lsquo;Bride&rsquo;s
Chamber Talk.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was begun as early as
&lsquo;Jenny,&rsquo; read by Allingham in 1860, but not printed
till more than a quarter of a century later.&nbsp; The earliest
form is still in existence in MS., and although some of the lines
struck out are as poetry most lovely, the poem on the whole is
better without them.&nbsp; It was a theory <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>of
Rossetti&rsquo;s, indeed, that the very riches of the English
language made it necessary for the poet who would achieve
excellence to revise and manipulate his lines.&nbsp; And in
support of this he would contrast the amazing passion for
revision disclosed by Dr. Garnett&rsquo;s &lsquo;Relics of
Shelley,&rsquo; in which sometimes scarcely half a dozen of the
original words are left on a page, with Scott&rsquo;s metrical
narratives, which were sent to the printer in cantos as they were
written, like one of the contemporary novels thrown off for the
serials.&nbsp; The fact seems to be, however, that the
poet&rsquo;s power of reaching, as Scott reached, his own ideal
expression <i>per saltum</i>, or reaching it slowly and
tentatively, is simply a matter of temperament.&nbsp; For whose
verses are more loose-jointed than Byron&rsquo;s? whose diction
is more commonplace than his?&nbsp; And yet this is what the
greatest of Byron specialists, Mr John Murray, says in his
extremely interesting remarks upon Byron&rsquo;s
autograph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If we except Byron&rsquo;s dramatic pieces
and &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo; the first draft of Byron&rsquo;s
longer poems formed but a nucleus of the work as it was
printed.&nbsp; For example, &lsquo;English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers&rsquo; grew out of the &lsquo;British Bards,&rsquo;
while &lsquo;The Giaour,&rsquo; by constant additions to the
manuscript, the proofs, and even to the work after publication,
was expanded to nearly twice its original size. . . . When the
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>inspiration was on him, the printer had to be kept at
work the greater part of the night, and fresh &lsquo;copy&rsquo;
and fresh revises were crossing one another hour by
hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that poets cannot be classified according to
their methods of work, but only in relation to the result of
those methods, and that our two great elaborators, Byron and
Rossetti, may still be more unlike each other in essentials than
are any other two nineteenth-century poets.</p>
<p>On the whole, we cannot help closing this book with kindly
feelings towards the editor, inasmuch as it aids in the good work
of restoring the true portrait of the man who has suffered more
than any other from the mischievous malignity of foes and the
more mischievous indiscretion of certain of his friends.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb was so paralyzed, it is said, by
Coleridge&rsquo;s death, that for weeks after that event, he was
heard murmuring often to himself, &ldquo;Coleridge is dead,
Coleridge is dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; In such a mental condition at
this moment is an entire country, I think.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tennyson
is dead!&nbsp; Tennyson is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be some
time before England&rsquo;s loss can really be expressed by any
words so powerful in pathos and in sorrow as these.&nbsp; And if
this is so with regard to English people generally, what of those
few who knew the man, and knowing him, must needs love
him&mdash;must needs love him above all others?&mdash;those, I
mean, who, when speaking of him, used to talk not so much about
the poetry as about the man who wrote it&mdash;those who now are
saying, with a tremor of the voice, and a moistening of the
eye:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was none like him&mdash;none.</p>

<p>To say wherein lies the secret of the charm of anything that
lives is mostly difficult.&nbsp; Especially <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>is it so
with regard to a man of poetic genius.&nbsp; All are agreed, for
instance, that D. G. Rossetti possessed an immense charm.&nbsp;
So he did, indeed.&nbsp; But who has been able to define that
charm?&nbsp; I, too, knew Rossetti well, and loved him
well.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, the egotism of a sorrowing memory
makes me think that outside his own most affectionate and
noble-tempered family, including that old friend in art at whose
feet he sat as a boy, no man loved Rossetti so deeply and so
lastingly as I did; unless, perhaps, it was the poor blind poet,
Philip Marston, who, being so deeply stricken, needed to love and
to be loved more sorely than I, to whom Fate has been kind.&nbsp;
And yet I should find it difficult to say wherein lay the charm
of Rossetti&rsquo;s chameleon-like personality.&nbsp; So with
other men and women I could name.&nbsp; This is not so in regard
to the great man now lying dead at Aldworth.&nbsp; Nothing is
easier than to define the charm of Tennyson.</p>
<p>It lay in a great veracity of soul&mdash;in a
simple-mindedness so childlike that, unless you had known him to
be the undoubted author of his exquisitely artistic poems, you
would have supposed that even the subtleties of poetic art must
be foreign to a nature so devoid of all subtlety as his.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Homer,&rdquo; you would have said, &ldquo;might have been
such a man as this, for Homer worked in a language which is
Poetry&rsquo;s very voice.&nbsp; But Tennyson works in a language
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>which has to be moulded into harmony by a myriad
subtleties of art.&nbsp; How can this great inspired child, who
yet has the simple wisdom of Bragi, the poetry-smith of the
Northern Olympus, be the delicate-fingered artist of &lsquo;The
Princess,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Palace of Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Day-Dream,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Dream of Fair
Women&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As deeply as some men feel that language was given to men to
disguise their thoughts did Tennyson feel that language was given
to <i>him</i> to declare his thoughts without disguise.&nbsp; He
knew of but one justification for the thing he said, viz., that
it was the thing he thought.&nbsp; <i>Arri&egrave;re
pens&eacute;e</i> was with him impossible.&nbsp; But, it may be
asked, when a man carries out-speaking to such a pass as this, is
he not apt to become a somewhat troublesome and discordant thread
in the complex web of modern society?&nbsp; No doubt any other
man than Tennyson would have been so.&nbsp; But the honest ring
in the voice&mdash;which, by-the-by, was strengthened and
deepened by the old-fashioned Lincolnshire accent&mdash;softened
and, to a great degree, neutralized the effect of the
bluntness.&nbsp; Moreover, behind this uncompromising directness
was apparent a noble and a splendid courtesy; for, above all
things, Tennyson was a great and forthright English
gentleman.&nbsp; As he stood at the porch at Aldworth, meeting a
guest or bidding him good-bye&mdash;as he stood there, tall, far
beyond the height of average men, his naturally <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>fair skin showing dark and tanned by the sun and
wind&mdash;as he stood there no one could mistake him for
anything but a great gentleman, who was also much more.&nbsp; Up
to the last a man of extraordinary presence, he showed, I think,
the beauty of old age to a degree rarely seen.</p>
<p>A friend of his who, visiting him on his birthday, discovered
him thus standing at the door to welcome him, has described his
unique appearance in words which are literally accurate at
least:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A poet should be limned in youth, they say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else in prime, with eyes and forehead beaming<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of manhood&rsquo;s noon&mdash;the very body
seeming<br />
To lend the spirit wings to win the bay;<br />
But here stands he whose noontide blooms for aye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose eyes, where past and future both are
gleaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With lore beyond all youthful poets&rsquo;
dreaming,<br />
Seem lit from shores of some far-glittering day.</p>
<p>Our master&rsquo;s prime is now&mdash;is ever now;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our star that wastes not in the wastes of night<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Holds Nature&rsquo;s dower undimmed in Time&rsquo;s
despite;<br />
Those eyes seem Wisdom&rsquo;s own beneath that brow,<br />
Where every furrow Time hath dared to plough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shines a new bar of still diviner light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, was the secret of Tennyson&rsquo;s personal
charm.&nbsp; And if the reader is sceptical as to its magnetic
effect upon his friends, let me remind him of the amazing rarity
of these great and guileless natures; let me remind him also that
this world is comprised of two classes of people&mdash;the bores,
whose name is legion, and the interesting people, whose name is
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span><i>not</i> legion&mdash;the former being those whose
natural instinct of self-protective mimicry impels them to move
about among their fellows hiding their features behind a mask of
convention, the latter being those who move about with uncovered
faces just as Nature fashioned them.&nbsp; If guilelessness lends
interest to a dullard, it is still more so with the really
luminous souls.&nbsp; So infinite is the creative power of nature
that she makes no two individuals alike.&nbsp; If we only had the
power of inquiring into the matter, we should find not only that
each individual creature that once inhabited one of the minute
shells that go to the building of England&rsquo;s fortress walls
of chalk was absolutely unlike all the others, but that even the
poor microbe himself, who in these days is so maligned, is also
very intensely an individual.</p>
<p>Some time ago the old discussion was revived in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i> as to whether the nightingale&rsquo;s song was
joyful or melancholy.&nbsp; And, perhaps, if the poems of the
late James Thomson and the poems of Mr. Austin Dobson were
recited by their authors to a congregation of nightingales, the
question would at once be debated amongst them, &ldquo;Is the
note of the human songster joyful or melancholy?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
truth is that the humidity or the dryness of the atmosphere in
the various habitats of the nightingale modifies so greatly the
<i>timbre</i> of the voice that, while a nightingale chorus at
Fiesole may seem joyous, <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>a
nightingale chorus in the moist thickets along the banks of the
Ouse may seem melancholy.&nbsp; Nay, more, as I once told
Tennyson at Aldworth, I, when a truant boy wandering along the
banks of the Ouse (where six nightingales&rsquo; nests have been
found in the hedge of a single meadow), got so used to these
matters that I had my own favourite individuals, and could easily
distinguish one from another.&nbsp; That rich climacteric swell
which is reached just before the &ldquo;jug, jug, jug,&rdquo;
varies amazingly, if the listener will only give the matter
attention.&nbsp; And if this infinite variety of individualism is
thus seen in the lower animals, what must it be in man?</p>
<p>There is, however, in the entire human race, a fatal instinct
for marring itself.&nbsp; To break down the exterior signs of
this variety of individualism in the race by mutual imitation, by
all sorts of affectations, is the object not only of the
civilization of the Western world, but of the very negroes on the
Gaboon River.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that whensoever we meet, as
at rarest interval we do meet, an individual who is able to
preserve his personality as Nature meant it to live, we feel an
attraction towards him such as is irresistible.&nbsp; Now I would
challenge those who knew him to say whether they ever knew any
other man so free from this great human infirmity as
Tennyson.&nbsp; The way in which his simplicity of nature would
manifest <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>itself was, in some instances, most
remarkable.&nbsp; Though, of course, he had his share of that
egoism of the artist without which imaginative genius may become
sterile, it seemed impossible for him to realize what a
transcendent position he took among contemporary writers all over
the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poets,&rdquo; he once said to me,
&ldquo;have not had the advantage of being <i>born</i> to the
purple.&rdquo;&nbsp; Up to the last he felt himself to be a poet
at struggle more or less with the Wilsons and the Crokers who, in
his youth, assailed him.&nbsp; I, and a very dear friend of his,
a family connexion, tried in vain to make him see that when a
poet had reached a position such as he had won, no criticism
could injure him or benefit him one jot.</p>
<p>What has been called his exclusiveness is entirely
mythical.&nbsp; He was the most hospitable of men.&nbsp; It was
very rare, indeed, for him to part from a friend at his hall
door, or at the railway station without urging him to return as
soon as possible, and generally with the words, &ldquo;Come
whenever you like.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact is, however, that for
many years the strangest notions seem to have got abroad as to
the claims of the public upon men of genius.&nbsp; There seems
now to be scarcely any one who does not look upon every man who
has passed into the purgatory of fame as his or her common
property.&nbsp; The unlucky victim is to be pestered by letters
upon every sort of foolish subject, and to be hunted <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>down in his walks and insulted by senseless
adulation.&nbsp; Tennyson resented this, and so did Rossetti, and
so ought every man who has reached eminence and respects his own
genius.&nbsp; Neither fame nor life itself is worth having on
such terms as these.</p>
<p>One day, Tennyson when walking round his garden at
Farringford, saw perched up in the trees that surrounded it, two
men who had been refused admittance at the gate&mdash;two men
dressed like gentlemen.&nbsp; He very wisely gave the public to
understand that his fame was not to be taken as an abrogation of
his rights as a private English gentleman.&nbsp; For my part,
whenever I hear any one railing against a man of eminence with
whom he cannot possibly have been brought into contact, I know at
once what it means: the railer has been writing an idle letter to
the eminent one and received no reply.</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s knowledge of nature&mdash;nature in every
aspect&mdash;was very great.&nbsp; His passion for
&ldquo;star-gazing&rdquo; has often been commented upon by
readers of his poetry.&nbsp; Since Dante no poet in any land has
so loved the stars.&nbsp; He had an equal delight in watching the
lightning; and I remember being at Aldworth once during a
thunderstorm, when I was alarmed at the temerity with which he
persisted, in spite of all remonstrances, in gazing at the
blinding lightning.&nbsp; For moonlight effects he had a passion
equally strong, and it is especially pathetic to <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>those who know this to remember that he passed away in
the light he so loved&mdash;in a room where there was no
artificial light&mdash;nothing to quicken the darkness but the
light of the full moon (which somehow seems to shine more
brightly at Aldworth than anywhere else in England); and that on
the face of the poet, as he passed away, fell that radiance in
which he so loved to bathe it when alive.</p>
<p>If it is as easy to describe the personal attraction of
Tennyson as it is difficult to describe that of any one of his
great contemporaries, we do not find the same relations existing
between him and them as regards his place in the firmament of
English poetry.&nbsp; In a country with a composite language such
as ours, it may be affirmed with special emphasis, that there are
two kinds of poetry; one appealing to the uncultivated masses,
whose vocabulary is of the narrowest; the other appealing to the
few who, partly by temperament, and partly by education, are
sensitive to the true beauties of poetic art.&nbsp; While in the
one case the appeal is made through a free and popular use of
words, partly commonplace and partly steeped in that literary
sentimentalism which in certain stages of an artificial society
takes the place of the simple utterances of simple passion of
earlier and simpler times; in the other case the appeal is made
very largely through what Dante calls the &ldquo;use of the sieve
for noble words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>Of the one perhaps Byron is the type, the exemplars
being such poets as those of the Mrs. Hemans school in England,
and of the Longfellow school in America.&nbsp; Of the other class
of poets, the class typified by Milton, the most notable
exemplars are Keats, Shelley, and Coleridge.&nbsp; Wordsworth
partakes of the qualities of both classes.&nbsp; The methods of
the first of these two groups are so cheap&mdash;they are so
based on the wide severance between the popular taste and the
poetic temper (which, though in earlier times it inspired the
people, is now confined to the few)&mdash;that one may say of the
first group that their success in finding and holding an audience
is almost damnatory to them as poets.&nbsp; As compared with the
poets of Greece, however, both groups may be said to have secured
only a partial success in poetry; for not only &AElig;schylus and
Sophocles, but Homer too, are as satisfying in the matter of
noble words as though they had never tried to win that popular
success which was their goal.&nbsp; In this respect&mdash;as
being, I mean, the compeer of the great poets of
Greece&mdash;Shakespeare takes his peculiar place in English
poetry.&nbsp; Of all poets he is the most popular, and yet in his
use of the &ldquo;sieve for noble words&rdquo; his skill
transcends that of even Milton, Coleridge, Shelley, and
Keats.&nbsp; His felicities of diction in the great passages seem
little short of miraculous, and they are so many that it is <!--
page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>easy to understand why he is so often spoken of as
being a kind of inspired improvisatore.&nbsp; That he was
<i>not</i> an improvisatore, however, any one can see who will
take the trouble to compare the first edition of &lsquo;Romeo and
Juliet&rsquo; with the received text, the first sketch of
&lsquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo; with the play as we now
have it, and the &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; of 1603 with the
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; of 1604, and with the still further varied
version of the play given by Heminge and Condell in the Folio of
1623.&nbsp; If we take into account, moreover, that it is only by
the lucky chapter of accidents that we now possess the earlier
forms of the three plays mentioned above, and that most likely
the other plays were once in a like condition, we shall come to
the conclusion that there was no more vigilant worker with
Dante&rsquo;s sieve than Shakespeare.&nbsp; Next to Shakespeare
in this great power of combining the forces of the two great
classes of English poets, appealing both to the commonplace sense
of a commonplace public and to the artistic sense of the few,
stands, perhaps, Chaucer; but since Shakespeare&rsquo;s time no
one has met with anything like Tennyson&rsquo;s success in
effecting a reconciliation between popular and artistic sympathy
with poetry in England.</p>
<p>The biography of such a poet, one who has had such an immense
influence upon the literary history of the entire Victorian
epoch&mdash;<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>indeed, upon the nineteenth century,
for his work covers two-thirds of the century&mdash;will be a
work of incalculable importance.&nbsp; There is but one man who
is fully equipped for such an undertaking, and fortunately that
is his own son&mdash;a man of great ability, of admirable
critical acumen, and of quite exceptional accomplishments.&nbsp;
His son&rsquo;s filial affection was so precious to Tennyson
that, although the poet&rsquo;s powers remained undimmed to the
last day of his life, I do not believe that we should have had
all the splendid work of the last ten years without his
affectionate and unwearied aid.</p>
<h3><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>II.</h3>
<p>All emotion&mdash;that of communities as well as that of
individuals&mdash;is largely governed by the laws of ebb and
flow.&nbsp; It is immediately after a national mourning for the
loss of a great man that a wave of reaction generally sets
in.&nbsp; But the eagerness with which these volumes <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a> have been awaited shows that
Tennyson&rsquo;s hold upon the British public is as strong at
this moment as it was on the day of his death.&nbsp; This very
popularity of his, however, has sometimes been spoken of by
critics as though it were an impeachment of him as a poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The English public is commonplace,&rdquo; they say,
&ldquo;and hence the commonplace in poetry suits it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And no doubt this is true as a general saying, otherwise what
would become of certain English poetasters who are such a joy to
the many and such a source of laughter to the few?&nbsp; But a
hardy critic would he be who should characterize Tennyson&rsquo;s
poetry as commonplace&mdash;that very poetry which, before it
became popular, was decried because it was merely &ldquo;poetry
for poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still that poetry so rich and so rare as
his <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>should find its way to the heart of
a people like the English, who have &ldquo;not sufficient poetic
instinct in them to give birth to vernacular poetry,&rdquo; is
undoubtedly a striking fact.&nbsp; With regard to the mass of his
work, he belonged to those poets whose appeal is as much through
their mastery over the more subtle beauties of poetic art as
through the heat of the poetic fire; and such as these must
expect to share the fate of Coleridge, Keats, and Shelley.&nbsp;
Every true poet must have an individual accent of his
own&mdash;an accent which is, however, recognizable as another
variation of that large utterance of the early gods common to all
true poets in all tongues.&nbsp; Is it not, then, in the nature
of things that, in England at least, &ldquo;the fit though
few&rdquo; comprise the audience of such a poet until the voice
of recognized Authority proclaims him?&nbsp; But Authority moves
slowly in these matters; years have to pass before the music of
the new voice can wind its way through the convolutions of the
general ear&mdash;so many years, indeed, that unless the poet is
blessed with the sublime self-esteem of Wordsworth he generally
has to die in the belief that his is another name &ldquo;written
in water.&rdquo;&nbsp; And was it always so?&nbsp; Yes,
always.</p>
<p>England having, as we have said, no vernacular song, her
poetry is entirely artistic, even such poetry as &lsquo;The May
Queen,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Northern Farmer,&rsquo; and the idyls of
<!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>William Barnes.&nbsp; And it would be strange indeed
if, until Authority spoke out, the beauties of artistic poetry
were ever apparent to the many.&nbsp; Is it supposable, for
instance, that even the voice of Chaucer&mdash;is it supposable
that even the voice of Shakspeare&mdash;would have succeeded in
winning the contemporary ear had it not been for that great mass
of legendary and romantic material which each of these found
ready to his hand, waiting to be moulded into poetic form?&nbsp;
The fate, however, of Moore&rsquo;s poetical narratives (perhaps
we might say of Byron&rsquo;s too) shows that if any poetry is to
last beyond the generation that produced it, there is needed not
only the romantic material, but also the accent, new and true, of
the old poetic voice.&nbsp; And these volumes show why in these
late days, when the poet&rsquo;s inheritance of romantic material
seemed to have been exhausted, there appeared one poet to whom
the English public gave an acceptance as wide almost as if he had
written in the vernacular like Burns or B&eacute;ranger.</p>
<p>It is long since any book has been so eagerly looked forward
to as this.&nbsp; The main facts of Tennyson&rsquo;s life have
been matter of familiar knowledge for so many years that we do
not propose to run over them here once more.&nbsp; Nor shall we
fill the space at our command with the biographer&rsquo;s
interesting personal anecdotes.&nbsp; So fierce a light had been
beating upon Aldworth <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and Farringford that the relations
of the present Lord Tennyson to his father were pretty generally
known.&nbsp; In the story of English poetry these relations held
a place that was quite unique.&nbsp; What the biographer says
about the poet&rsquo;s sagacity, judgment, and good
sense&mdash;especially what he says about his insight into the
characters of those with whom he was brought into
contact&mdash;will be challenged by no one who knew him.&nbsp;
Still, the fact remains that Tennyson&rsquo;s temperament was
poetic entirely.&nbsp; And the more attention the poet pays to
his art, the more unfitted does he become to pay attention to
anything else.&nbsp; For in these days the mechanism of social
life moves on grating wheels that need no little oiling if the
poet is to bring out the very best that is within him.&nbsp; Not
that all poets are equally vexed by the special infirmity of the
poetic temperament.&nbsp; Poets like Wordsworth, for instance,
are supported against the world by love of Nature and by that
&ldquo;divine arrogance&rdquo; which is sometimes a
characteristic of genius.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s case shows that
not even love of Nature and intimate communings with her are of
use in giving a man peace when he has not Wordsworth&rsquo;s
temperament.&nbsp; No adverse criticism could disturb
Wordsworth&rsquo;s sublime self-complacency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; writes Jowett, with his usual
wisdom, to Lord Tennyson, &ldquo;was very sensitive, <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>and had an honest hatred of being gossiped about.&nbsp;
He called the malignant critics and chatterers
&lsquo;mosquitos.&rsquo;&nbsp; He never felt any pleasure at
praise (except from his friends), but he felt a great pain at the
injustice of censure.&nbsp; It never occurred to him that a new
poet in the days of his youth was sure to provoke dangerous
hostilities in the &lsquo;genus irritabile vatum&rsquo; and in
the old-fashioned public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might almost be said, indeed, that had it not been for the
ministrations, first of his beloved wife, and then of his sons,
Tennyson&rsquo;s life would have been one long warfare between
the attitude of his splendid intellect towards the universe and
the response of his nervous system to human criticism.&nbsp; From
his very childhood he seems to have had that instinct for
confronting the universe as a whole which, except in the case of
Shakespeare, is not often seen among poets.&nbsp; Star-gazing and
speculation as to the meaning of the stars and what was going on
in them seem to have begun in his childhood.&nbsp; In his first
Cambridge letter to his aunt, Mrs. Russell, written from No. 12,
Rose Crescent, he says, &ldquo;I am sitting owl-like and solitary
in my room, nothing between me and the stars but a stratum of
tiles.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his son tells us of a story current in
the family that Frederick, when an Eton schoolboy, was shy of
going to a neighbouring dinner-party to which <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>he had been
invited.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fred,&rdquo; said his younger brother,
&ldquo;think of Herschel&rsquo;s great star-patches, and you will
soon get over all that.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had Wordsworth&rsquo;s
passion, too, for communing with Nature alone.&nbsp; He was one
of Nature&rsquo;s elect who knew that even the company of a dear
and intimate friend, howsoever close, is a disturbance of the
delight that intercourse with her can afford to the true
devotee.&nbsp; In a letter to his future wife, written from
Mablethorpe in 1839, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am not so able as in old years to commune
<i>alone</i> with Nature . . . Dim mystic sympathies with tree
and hill reaching far back into childhood, a known landskip is to
me an old friend, that continually talks to me of my own youth
and half-forgotten things, and indeed does more for me than many
an old friend that I know.&nbsp; An old park is my delight, and I
could tumble about it for ever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, he was always speculating upon the mystery and the
wonder of the human story.&nbsp; &ldquo;The far future,&rdquo; he
says in a letter to Miss Sellwood, written from High Beech in
Epping Forest, &ldquo;has been my world always.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
yet so powerless is reason in that dire wrestle with temperament
which most poets know, that with all these causes for despising
criticism of his work, Tennyson was as sensitive to critical
strictures as Wordsworth was indifferent.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
fancied,&rdquo; says his biographer, <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>&ldquo;that
England was an unsympathetic atmosphere, and half resolved to
live abroad in Jersey, in the South of France, or in Italy.&nbsp;
He was so far persuaded that the English people would never care
for his poetry, that, had it not been for the intervention of his
friends, he declared it not unlikely that after the death of
Hallam he would not have continued to write.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
again, in reference to the completion of &lsquo;The Sleeping
Beauty,&rsquo; his son says, &ldquo;He warmed to his work because
there had been a favourable review of him lately published in
far-off Calcutta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We dwell upon this weakness of Tennyson&rsquo;s&mdash;a
weakness which, in view of his immense powers, was certainly a
source of wonder to his friends&mdash;in order to show, once for
all, that without the tender care of his son he could never in
his later years have done the work he did.&nbsp; This it was
which caused the relations between Tennyson and the writer of
this admirable memoir to be those of brother with brother rather
than of father with son.&nbsp; And those who have been eagerly
looking forward to these volumes will not be disappointed.&nbsp;
In writing the life of any man there are scores and scores of
facts and documents, great and small, which only some person
closely acquainted with him, either as relative or as friend, can
bring into their true light; and this it is which makes documents
so deceptive.&nbsp; Here is an instance of what we mean.&nbsp; In
writing to Thompson, Spedding <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>says of
Tennyson on a certain occasion: &ldquo;I could not get Alfred to
Rydal Mount.&nbsp; He would and would not (sulky one!), although
Wordsworth was hospitably minded towards him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
remark would inevitably have been construed into another instance
of that churlishness which is so often said (though quite
erroneously) to have been one of Tennyson&rsquo;s
infirmities.&nbsp; But when we read the following foot-note by
the biographer, &ldquo;He said he did not wish to intrude himself
on the great man at Rydal,&rdquo; we accept the incident as
another proof of that &ldquo;humility&rdquo; which the son
alludes to in his preface as being one of his father&rsquo;s
characteristics.&nbsp; And of such evidence that had not the
poet&rsquo;s son written his biography the loss to literature
would have been incalculable the book is full.&nbsp; Evidence of
a fine intellect, a fine culture, and a sure judgment is afforded
by every page&mdash;afforded as much by what is left unsaid as by
what is said.</p>
<p>The biographer has invited a few of the poet&rsquo;s friends
to furnish their impressions of him.&nbsp; These could not fail
to be interesting; it is pleasant to know what impression
Tennyson made upon men of such diverse characters as the Duke of
Argyll, Jowett, Tyndall, Froude, and others.&nbsp; But so far as
a vital portrait of the man is concerned they were not needed, so
vigorously does the man live in the portrait painted by him who
knew the poet best of all.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; says the biographer,
&ldquo;I feel strongly that no biographer could so truly give him
as he gives himself in his own works; but this may be because,
having lived my life with him, I see him in every word which he
has written; and it is difficult for me so far to detach myself
from the home circle as to pourtray him for others.&nbsp; There
is also the impossibility of fathoming a great man&rsquo;s mind;
his deeper thoughts are hardly ever revealed.&nbsp; He himself
disliked the notion of a long, formal biography, for</p>
<blockquote><p>None can truly write his single day,<br />
And none can write it for him upon earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;However, he wished that, if I deemed it better, the
incidents of his life should be given as shortly as might be
without comment, but that my notes should be final and full
enough to preclude the chance of further and unauthentic
biographies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those who cared to know about his literary history
he wrote &lsquo;Merlin and the Gleam.&rsquo;&nbsp; From his
boyhood he had felt the magic of Merlin&mdash;that spirit of
poetry&mdash;which bade him know his power and follow throughout
his work a pure and high ideal, with a simple and single
devotedness and a desire to ennoble the life of the world, and
which helped him through doubts and difficulties to &lsquo;endure
as seeing Him who is invisible.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Great the Master,<br />
And sweet the Magic,<br />
When over the valley,<br />
In early summers,<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Over the mountain,<br />
On human faces,<br />
And all around me,<br />
Moving to melody,<br />
Floated the Gleam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In his youth he sang of the brook flowing through his
upland valley, of the &lsquo;ridged wolds&rsquo; that rose above
his home, of the mountain-glen and snowy summits of his early
dreams, and of the beings, heroes and fairies, with which his
imaginary world was peopled.&nbsp; Then was heard the
&lsquo;croak of the raven,&rsquo; the harsh voice of those who
were unsympathetic&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The light retreated,<br />
The Landskip darken&rsquo;d,<br />
The melody deaden&rsquo;d,<br />
The Master whisper&rsquo;d,<br />
&lsquo;Follow the Gleam.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Still the inward voice told him not to be faint-hearted
but to follow his ideal.&nbsp; And by the delight in his own
romantic fancy, and by the harmonies of nature, &lsquo;the warble
of water,&rsquo; and &lsquo;cataract music of falling
torrents,&rsquo; the inspiration of the poet was renewed.&nbsp;
His Eclogues and English Idyls followed, when he sang the songs
of country life and the joys and griefs of country folk, which he
knew through and through,</p>
<blockquote><p>Innocent maidens,<br />
Garrulous children,<br />
Homestead and harvest,<br />
Reaper and gleaner,<br />
And rough-ruddy faces<br />
Of lowly labour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By degrees, having learnt somewhat of the real
philosophy of life and of humanity from his own experience, he
rose to a melody &lsquo;stronger <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>and
statelier.&rsquo;&nbsp; He celebrated the glory of &lsquo;human
love and of human heroism&rsquo; and of human thought, and began
what he had already devised, his epic of King Arthur,
&lsquo;typifying above all things the life of man,&rsquo; wherein
he had intended to represent some of the great religions of the
world.&nbsp; He had purposed that this was to be the chief work
of his manhood.&nbsp; Yet the death of his friend, Arthur Hallam,
and the consequent darkening of the whole world for him made him
almost fail in this purpose; nor any longer for a while did he
rejoice in the splendour of his spiritual visions, nor in the
Gleam that had &lsquo;waned to a wintry glimmer.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Clouds and darkness<br />
Closed upon Camelot;<br />
Arthur had vanish&rsquo;d<br />
I knew not whither,<br />
The King who loved me,<br />
And cannot die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here my father united the two Arthurs, the Arthur of
the Idylls and the Arthur &lsquo;the man he held as half
divine.&rsquo;&nbsp; He himself had fought with death, and had
come out victorious to find &lsquo;a stronger faith his
own,&rsquo; and a hope for himself, for all those in sorrow and
for universal human kind, that never forsook him through the
future years.</p>
<blockquote><p>And broader and brighter<br />
The Gleam flying onward,<br />
Wed to the melody,<br />
Sang thro&rsquo; the world.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I saw, wherever<br />
In passing it glanced upon<br />
Hamlet or city,<br />
That under the Crosses<br />
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>The dead man&rsquo;s garden,<br />
The mortal hillock,<br />
Would break into blossom;<br />
And so to the land&rsquo;s<br />
Last limit I came.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Up to the end he faced death with the same earnest and
unfailing courage that he had always shown, but with an added
sense of the awe and the mystery of the Infinite.</p>
<blockquote><p>I can no longer,<br />
But die rejoicing,<br />
For thro&rsquo; the Magic<br />
Of Him the Mighty,<br />
Who taught me in childhood,<br />
There on the border<br />
Of boundless Ocean,<br />
And all but in Heaven<br />
Hovers the Gleam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That is the reading of the poet&rsquo;s riddle as he
gave it to me.&nbsp; He thought that &lsquo;Merlin and the
Gleam&rsquo; would probably be enough of biography for those
friends who urged him to write about himself.&nbsp; However, this
has not been their verdict, and I have tried to do what he said
that I might do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many specialists in Tennysonian bibliography who
take a pride (and a worthy pride) in their knowledge of the
master&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; But the knowledge of all of these
specialists put together is not equal to that of him who writes
this book.&nbsp; Not only is every line at his fingers&rsquo;
ends, but he knows, either from his own memory or from what his
father has told him, where and when and why every line was
written.&nbsp; He, however, shares, it is evident that
dislike&mdash;<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>rather let us say that passionate
hatred&mdash;which his father, like so many other poets, had of
that well-intentioned but vexing being whom Rossetti
anathematized as the &ldquo;literary resurrection
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rossetti used to say that &ldquo;of all signs
that a man was devoid of poetic instinct and poetic feeling the
impulse of the literary resurrectionist was the
surest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without going so far as this we may at least
affirm that all poets writing in a language requiring, as English
does, much manipulation before it can be moulded into perfect
form must needs revise in the brain before the line is set down,
or in manuscript, as Shelley did, or partly in manuscript and
partly in type, as Coleridge did.&nbsp; But the rakers-up of the
&ldquo;chips of the workshop,&rdquo; to use Tennyson&rsquo;s own
phrase, seem to have been specially irritating to him, because he
belonged to those poets who cannot really revise and complete
their work till they see it in type.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poetry,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;looks better, more convincing in
print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the volume of 1832,&rdquo; says his son, &ldquo;he
omitted several stanzas of &lsquo;The Palace of Art&rsquo;
because he thought that the poem was too full.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
artist is known by his self-limitation&rsquo; was a favourite
adage of his.&nbsp; He allowed me, however, to print some of them
in my notes, otherwise I should have hesitated to quote without
his leave lines that he had excised.&nbsp; He &lsquo;gave the
people of his best,&rsquo; and <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>he usually
wished that his best should remain without variorum readings,
&lsquo;the chips of the workshop,&rsquo; as he called them.&nbsp;
The love of bibliomaniacs for first editions filled him with
horror, for the first editions are obviously in many cases the
worst editions, and once he said to me: &lsquo;Why do they
treasure the rubbish I shot from my full-finish&rsquo;d
cantos?&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nu;&eta;&pi;&iota;&omicron;&iota;
&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&epsilon;
&iota;&sigma;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&nu; &omicron;&sigma;&omega;
&pi;&lambda;&#941;&omicron;&nu; &eta;&mu;&iota;&sigma;&upsilon;
&pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For himself many passages in Wordsworth and other poets have
been entirely spoilt by the modern habit of giving every various
reading along with the text.&nbsp; Besides, in his case, very
often what is published as the latest edition has been the
original version in his first manuscript, so that there is no
possibility of really tracing the history of what may seem to be
a new word or a new passage.&nbsp; &lsquo;For instance,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;in &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; a line in the first edition
was &lsquo;I will bury myself in <i>my books</i>, and the Devil
may pipe to his own,&rsquo; which was afterwards altered to
&lsquo;I will bury myself <i>in myself</i>, &amp;c.&rsquo;: this
was highly commended by the critics as an improvement on the
<i>original</i> reading&mdash;but it was actually in the first
MS. draft of the poem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, it is important to get a statement by one entitled to
speak with authority as to what Tennyson did and what he did not
believe upon religious matters.&nbsp; He had in &lsquo;In
Memoriam&rsquo; and other poems touched with a hand so <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>strong and sometimes so daring upon the teaching of
modern science, and yet he had spoken always so reverently of
what modern civilization reverences, that the most opposite
lessons were read from his utterances.&nbsp; To one thinker it
would seem that Tennyson had thrown himself boldly upon the very
foremost wave of scientific thought.&nbsp; To another it would
seem that Wordsworth (although, living and writing when he did,
before the birth of the new cosmogony, he believed himself to be
still in trammels of the old) was by temperament far more in
touch with the new cosmogony than was Tennyson, who studied
evolution more ardently than any poet since Lucretius.&nbsp;
While Wordsworth, notwithstanding a conventional phrase here and
there, had an apprehension of Nature without the ever-present
idea of the Power behind her, Spinosa himself was not so
&ldquo;God-intoxicated&rdquo; a man as Tennyson.&nbsp; His son
sets the question at rest in the following pregnant
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly Religion was no nebulous abstraction for
him.&nbsp; He consistently emphasized his own belief in what he
called the Eternal Truths; in an Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and
All-loving God, Who has revealed Himself through the human
attribute of the highest self-sacrificing love; in the freedom of
the human will; and in the immortality of the soul.&nbsp; But he
asserted that &lsquo;Nothing worthy proving can be proven,&rsquo;
and that even as to the great laws which are the basis of
Science, &lsquo;We have <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>but faith,
we cannot know.&rsquo;&nbsp; He dreaded the dogmatism of sects
and rash definitions of God.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare hardly name His
Name,&rsquo; he would say, and accordingly he named Him in
&lsquo;The Ancient Sage&rsquo; the &lsquo;Nameless.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;But take away belief in the self-conscious personality of
God,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you take away the backbone of the
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;On God and God-like men we build our
trust.&rsquo;&nbsp; A week before his death I was sitting by him,
and he talked long of the Personality and of the Love of God,
&lsquo;That God, Whose eyes consider the poor,&rsquo; &lsquo;Who
catereth, even for the sparrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;infinitely rather feel myself the
most miserable wretch on the face of the earth with a God above,
than the highest type of man standing alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
would allow that God is unknowable in &lsquo;his whole
world-self, and all-in-all,&rsquo; and that, therefore, there was
some force in the objection made by some people to the word
&lsquo;Personality&rsquo; as being &lsquo;anthropomorphic,&rsquo;
and that, perhaps &lsquo;Self-consciousness&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Mind&rsquo; might be clearer to them: but at the same time
he insisted that, although &lsquo;man is like a thing of
nought&rsquo; in &lsquo;the boundless plan,&rsquo; our highest
view of God must be more or less anthropomorphic: and that
&lsquo;Personality,&rsquo; as far as our intelligence goes, is
the widest definition and includes &lsquo;Mind,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Self-consciousness,&rsquo; &lsquo;Will,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Love,&rsquo; and other attributes of the Real, the
Supreme, &lsquo;the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity,
Whose name is Holy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Lord Tennyson quotes a manuscript note of
Jowett&rsquo;s in which he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alfred Tennyson thinks it ridiculous to <!-- page
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>believe in a God and deny his consciousness, and was
amused at some one who said of him that he had versified
Hegelianism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He notes also an anecdote of Edward Fitzgerald&rsquo;s which
speaks of a week with Tennyson, when the poet, picking up a
daisy, and looking closely at its crimson-tipped leaves, said,
&ldquo;Does not this look like a thinking Artificer, one who
wishes to ornament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a paragraph which will be read with the deepest
interest, not only by every lover of poetry, but by every man
whose heart has been rung by the most terrible of all
bereavements&mdash;the loss of a beloved friend.&nbsp; Close as
the tie of blood relationship undoubtedly is, it is based upon
convention as much as upon nature.&nbsp; It may exist and
flourish vigorously when there is little or no community of taste
or of thought:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be as well to say here that all the letters from
my father to Arthur Hallam were destroyed by his father after
Arthur&rsquo;s death: a great loss, as these particular letters
probably revealed his inner self more truly than anything outside
his poems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We confess to belonging to those who always read with a twinge
of remorse the private letters of a man in print.&nbsp; But if
there is a case where one must needs long to see the letters
between two intimate friends, it is that of Tennyson and Arthur
Hallam.&nbsp; They would have been only second in interest to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>letters to that mysterious
&ldquo;Mr. W. H.&rdquo; whose identity now can never be
traced.&nbsp; For, notwithstanding all that has recently been
said, and ably said, to the contrary, the man to whom many of the
sonnets were addressed was he whom &ldquo;T. T.&rdquo; addresses
as &ldquo;Mr. W. H.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for an intimacy to be so strong as that which existed
between Tennyson and Arthur H. Hallam there must be a kinship of
soul so close and so rare that the tie of blood relationship
seems weak beside it.&nbsp; It is then that friendship may
sometimes pass from a sentiment into a passion.&nbsp; It did so
in the case of Shakespeare and his mysterious friend, as the
sonnets in question make manifest; but we are not aware that
there is in English literature any other instance of friendship
as a passion until we get to &lsquo;In Memoriam.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
profound was the effect of Hallam&rsquo;s death upon Tennyson
that it was the origin, his son tells us, of &lsquo;The Two
Voices; or, Thoughts of a Suicide.&rsquo;&nbsp; What was the
secret of Hallam&rsquo;s influence over Tennyson can never be
guessed from anything that he has left behind either in prose or
verse.&nbsp; But besides the creative genius of the artist there
is that genius of personality which is irresistible.&nbsp; With a
very large gift of this kind of genius Arthur Hallam seems to
have been endowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the letters from Arthur Hallam&rsquo;s
friends,&rdquo; says Lord Tennyson, &ldquo;there was a rare
unanimity <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>of opinion about his worth.&nbsp;
Milnes, writing to his father, says that he had a &lsquo;very
deep respect&rsquo; for Hallam, and that Thirlwall, in after
years the great bishop, for whom Hallam and my father had a
profound affection, was &lsquo;actually captivated by
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; When at Cambridge with Hallam he had written:
&lsquo;He is the only man here of my own standing before whom I
bow in conscious inferiority in everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alford
writes: &lsquo;Hallam was a man of wonderful mind and knowledge
on all subjects, hardly credible at his age. . . .&nbsp; I long
ago set him down for the most wonderful person I ever knew.&nbsp;
He was of the most tender, affectionate
disposition.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s remarks upon the &lsquo;Idylls of the
King,&rsquo; and upon the enormous success of the book have a
special interest, and serve to illustrate our opening remarks
upon the popularity of his father&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Popular as
Tennyson had become through &lsquo;The Gardener&rsquo;s
Daughter,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Miller&rsquo;s Daughter,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The May Queen,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Lord of Burleigh,&rsquo;
and scores of other poems&mdash;endeared to every sorrowing heart
as he had become through &lsquo;In Memoriam&rsquo;&mdash;it was
the &lsquo;Idylls of the King&rsquo; that secured for him his
unique place.&nbsp; Many explanations of the phenomenon of a true
poet securing the popular suffrages have been offered, one of
them being his acceptance of the Laureateship.&nbsp; But
Wordsworth, a great <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>poet, also accepted it; and he never
was and never will be popular.&nbsp; The wisdom of what Goethe
says about the enormous importance of &ldquo;subject&rdquo; in
poetic art is illustrated by the story of Tennyson and the
&lsquo;Idylls of the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For what was there in the &lsquo;Idylls of the King&rsquo;
that brought all England to Tennyson&rsquo;s feet&mdash;made
English people re-read with a new seeing in their eyes the poems
which they once thought merely beautiful, but now thought half
divine?&nbsp; Beautiful these &lsquo;Idylls&rsquo; are indeed,
but they are not more beautiful than work of his that went
before.&nbsp; The rich Klondyke of Malory and Geoffrey of
Monmouth had not escaped the eyes of previous prospectors.&nbsp;
All his life Milton had dreamed of the mines lying concealed in
the &ldquo;misty mid-region&rdquo; of King Arthur and the Round
Table, but, luckily for Tennyson, was led away from it into other
paths.&nbsp; With Milton&rsquo;s immense power of sensuous
expression&mdash;a power that impelled him, even when dealing
with the spirit world, to flash upon our senses pictures of the
very limbs of angels and fiends at fight&mdash;we may imagine
what an epic of King Arthur he would have produced.&nbsp; Dryden
also contemplated working in this mine, but never did; and until
Scott came with his Lyulph&rsquo;s Tale in &lsquo;The Bridal of
Triermain,&rsquo; no one had taken up the subject but writers
like Blackmore.&nbsp; Then came Bulwer&rsquo;s <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>burlesque.&nbsp; Now no prospector on the banks of the
Yukon has a keener eye for nuggets than Tennyson had for poetic
ore, and besides &lsquo;The Lady of Shalott&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Launcelot and Guinevere,&rsquo; he had already printed the
grandest of all his poems&mdash;the &lsquo;Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur.&rsquo;&nbsp; It needed only the &lsquo;Idylls of
the King,&rsquo; where episode after episode of the Arthurian
cycle was rendered in poems which could be understood by
all&mdash;it needed only this for all England to be set reading
and re-reading all his poems, some of them more precious than any
of these &lsquo;Idylls&rsquo;&mdash;poems whose familiar beauties
shone out now with a new light.</p>
<p>Ever since then Tennyson&rsquo;s hold upon the British public
seemed to grow stronger and stronger up to the day of his death,
when Great Britain, and, indeed, the entire English-speaking
race, went into mourning for him; nor, as we have said, has any
weakening of that hold been perceptible during the five years
that have elapsed since.</p>
<p>The volumes are so crammed with interesting and important
matter that to discuss them in one article is impossible.&nbsp;
But before concluding these remarks we must say that the good
fortune which attended Tennyson during his life did not end with
his death.&nbsp; Fortunate, indeed, is the famous man who escapes
the catchpenny biographer.&nbsp; No man so illustrious as
Tennyson ever before passed away without his death <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>giving rise to a flood of books professing to tell the
story of his life.&nbsp; Yet it chanced that for a long time
before his death a monograph on Tennyson by Mr. Arthur
Waugh&mdash;which, though of course it is sometimes at fault, was
carefully prepared and well considered&mdash;had been in
preparation, as had also a second edition of another sketch of
the poet&rsquo;s life by Mr. Henry Jennings, written with equal
reticence and judgment.&nbsp; These two books, coming out, as far
as we remember, in the very week of Tennyson&rsquo;s funeral, did
the good service of filling up the gap of five years until the
appearance of this authorized biography by his son.&nbsp;
Otherwise there is no knowing what pseudo-biographies stuffed
with what errors and nonsense might have flooded the market and
vexed the souls of Tennysonian students.&nbsp; For the future
such pseudo-biographies will be impossible.</p>
<h3><!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>III.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the apparently fortunate circumstances by
which Tennyson was surrounded, the record of his early life
produces in the reader&rsquo;s mind a sense of unhappiness.&nbsp;
Happiness is an affair of temperament, not of outward
circumstances.&nbsp; Happy, in the sense of enjoying the present
as Wordsworth enjoyed it, Tennyson could never be.&nbsp; Once, no
doubt, Nature&rsquo;s sweetest gift to all living
things&mdash;the power of enjoying the present&mdash;was
man&rsquo;s inheritance too.&nbsp; Some of the human family have
not lost it even yet; but poets are rarely of these.&nbsp; Give
Wordsworth any pittance, enough to satisfy the simplest physical
wants&mdash;enough to procure him plain living and leisure for
&ldquo;high thinking&rdquo;&mdash;and he would be happier than
Tennyson would have been, cracking the finest
&ldquo;walnuts&rdquo; and sipping the richest &ldquo;wine&rdquo;
amidst a circle of admiring and powerful friends.&nbsp; As to
opinion, as to criticism of his work&mdash;what was that to
Wordsworth?&nbsp; Had he not from the first the good opinion of
her of whom he was the high priest elect.&nbsp; Natura Benigna
herself?&nbsp; Nay, had he not from the first the good opinions
of Wordsworth himself and Dorothy?&nbsp; Without this faculty of
enjoying the <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>present, how can a bard be
happy?&nbsp; For the present alone exists.&nbsp; The past is a
dream; the future is a dream; the present is the narrow plank
thrown for an instant from the dream of the past to the dream of
the future.&nbsp; And yet it is the poet (who of all men should
enjoy the raree show hurrying and scrambling along the
plank)&mdash;it is he who refuses to enjoy himself on his own
trembling little plank in order to &ldquo;stare round&rdquo; from
side to side.</p>
<p>Spedding, speaking in a letter to Thompson in 1835 of
Tennyson&rsquo;s visit to the Lake country, lets fall a few words
that describe the poet in the period before his marriage more
fully than could have been done by a volume of subtle
analysis:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he took in more pleasure and inspiration than
any one would have supposed who did not know his own almost
personal dislike of the present, whatever it might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what makes us say that by far the most important thing
in Tennyson&rsquo;s life was his marriage.&nbsp; He began to
enjoy the present: &ldquo;The peace of God came into my life
before the altar when I wedded her.&rdquo;&nbsp; No more
beautiful words than these were ever uttered by any man
concerning any woman.&nbsp; And to say that the words were
Tennyson&rsquo;s is to say that they expressed the simple truth,
for his definition of human speech as God meant it to be would
have been &ldquo;the breath that utters truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
would <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>have been wonderful, indeed, if he,
whose capacity of loving a friend was so great had been without
an equal capacity of loving a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although as a son,&rdquo; says the biographer, &ldquo;I
cannot allow myself full utterance about her whom I loved as
perfect mother and &lsquo;very woman of very
woman&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;such a wife&rsquo; and true helpmate
she proved herself.&nbsp; It was she who became my father&rsquo;s
adviser in literary matters; &lsquo;I am proud of her
intellect,&rsquo; he wrote.&nbsp; With her he always discussed
what he was working at; she transcribed his poems: to her and to
no one else he referred for a final criticism before
publishing.&nbsp; She, with her &lsquo;tender, spiritual
nature,&rsquo; <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> and instinctive nobility of thought,
was always by his side, a ready, cheerful, courageous, wise, and
sympathetic counsellor.&nbsp; It was she who shielded his
sensitive spirit from the annoyances and trials of life,
answering (for example) the innumerable letters addressed to him
from all parts of the world.&nbsp; By her quiet sense of humour,
by her selfless devotion, by &lsquo;her faith as clear as the
heights of the June-blue heaven,&rsquo; she helped him also to
the utmost in the hours of his depression and of his
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some few people whose natures are so noble or so
sweet that how rich soever may be their endowment of intellect,
or even of genius, we seem to remember them mainly <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>by
what St. Gregory Nazianzen calls &ldquo;the rhetoric of their
lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; And surely the knowledge that this is so is
encouraging to him who would fain believe in the high destiny of
man&mdash;surely it is encouraging to know that, in spite of
&ldquo;the inhuman dearth of noble natures,&rdquo; mankind can
still so dearly love moral beauty as to hold it more precious
than any other human force.&nbsp; And certainly one of those
whose intellectual endowments are outdazzled by the beauty of
their qualities of heart and soul was the sweet lady whose death
I am recording.</p>
<p>Among those who had the privilege of knowing Lady Tennyson
(and they were many, and these many were of the best), some are
at this moment eloquent in talk about the perfect helpmate she
was to the great poet, and the perfect mother she was to his
children, and they quote those lovely lines of Tennyson which
every one knows by heart:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear, near and true&mdash;no truer Time himself<br
/>
Can prove you, tho&rsquo; he make you evermore<br />
Dearer and nearer, as the rapid of life<br />
Shoots to the fall&mdash;take this and pray that he<br />
Who wrote it, honouring your sweet faith to him,<br />
May trust himself;&mdash;and after praise and scorn,<br />
As one who feels the immeasurable world,<br />
Attain the wise indifference of the wise;<br />
And after autumn past&mdash;if left to pass<br />
His autumn into seeming leafless days&mdash;<br />
Draw toward the long frost and longest night,<br />
Wearing his wisdom lightly, like the fruit<br />
Which in our winter woodland looks a flower.</p>

158</span>Others dwell on the unique way in which those wistful
blue eyes of hers and that beautiful face expressed the
&ldquo;tender spiritual nature&rdquo; described by the
poet&mdash;expressed it, indeed, more and more eloquently with
the passage of years, and the bereavements the years had
brought.&nbsp; The present writer saw her within a few days of
her death.&nbsp; She did not seem to him then more fragile than
ordinary.&nbsp; For many years she whose fragile frame seemed to
be kept alive by the love and sweet movements of the soul within
had seemed as she lay upon her couch the same as she seemed when
death was so near&mdash;intensely pale, save when a flush as
slight as the pink on a wild rose told her watchful son that the
subject of conversation was interesting her more than was well
for her.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, however, Lady Tennyson was no
less remarkable as an intelligence than as the central heart of
love and light that illumined one of the most beautiful
households of our time.</p>
<p>Though her special gift was no doubt music, she had, as
Tennyson would say with affectionate pride, a &ldquo;real insight
into poetical effects&rdquo;; and those who knew her best shared
his opinion in this matter.&nbsp; Whether, had her life not been
devoted so entirely to others, she would have been a noticeable
artistic producer it is hard to guess.&nbsp; But there is no
doubt that she was born to hold a high place as a
conversationalist, <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>brilliant and stimulating.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the jealous watchfulness of her family lest the
dinner talk should draw too heavily upon her small stock of
physical power, the fascination of her conversation, both as to
subject-matter and manner, was so irresistible that her friends
were apt to forget how fragile she really was until warned by a
sign from her son or, daughter-in-law, who adored her, that the
conversation should be brought to a close.</p>
<p>Her diary, upon which her son has drawn for certain
biographical portions of his book shows how keen and how
persistent was her interest in the poetry of her husband; it also
shows how thorough was her insight into its principles.&nbsp; As
a rule, diaries, professing as they do to give portraitures of
eminent men, are mostly very much worse than worthless.&nbsp; The
points seized upon by the diarist are almost never physiognomic,
and even if the diarist does give some glimpse of the character
he professes to limn, the picture can only be partially true,
inasmuch as it can never be toned down by other aspects of the
character unseen by the diarist and unknown to him.</p>
<p>Very different, however, is the record kept by Lady
Tennyson.&nbsp; As an instance of her power of selecting really
luminous points for preservation in her diary, let me instance
this.&nbsp; Many a student of the &lsquo;Idylls of the
King&rsquo; has been struck by a certain difference in the style
<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>between &lsquo;The Coming of Arthur&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Passing of Arthur&rsquo; and the other idylls.&nbsp;
Indeed, more than once this difference has been cited as showing
Tennyson&rsquo;s inability to fuse the different portions of a
long poem.&nbsp; This fact had not escaped the eye of the loving
wife and critic, and two days before her death she said to her
son, &ldquo;He said &lsquo;The Coming of Arthur&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Passing of Arthur&rsquo; are purposely simpler in
style than the other idylls as dealing with the awfulness of
birth and death,&rdquo; and wished this remark of the
poet&rsquo;s to be put on record in the book.</p>
<p>It is needless to comment on the value of these few words and
the light they shed upon Tennyson&rsquo;s method.</p>
<p>Those who saw Lady Tennyson in middle life and in advanced
age, and were struck by that spiritual beauty of hers which no
painter could ever render, will not find it difficult to imagine
what she was at seventeen, when Tennyson suddenly came upon her
in the &ldquo;Fairy Wood,&rdquo; and exclaimed, &ldquo;Are you an
Oread or a Dryad wandering here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet her beauty
was only a small part of a charm that was indescribable.&nbsp; An
important event for English literature was that meeting in the
&ldquo;Fairy Wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, from the moment of his
engagement, &ldquo;the current of his mind was no longer and
constantly in the channel of mournful memories and melancholy
forebodings,&rdquo; <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>says his son.&nbsp; And speaking of
the year, 1838, the son tells us that, on the whole, he was happy
in his life.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I wrote &lsquo;The Two
Voices,&rsquo;&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;I was so utterly
miserable, a burden to myself and my family, that I said,
&lsquo;Is life worth anything?&rsquo; and now that I am old, I
fear that I shall only live a year or two, for I have work still
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostile manner in which &lsquo;Maud&rsquo; was received
vexed him, and would, before his marriage, have deeply disturbed
him.&nbsp; A right view of this fine poem seems to have been
taken by George Brimley, an admirable critic, who in the
&lsquo;Cambridge Essays,&rsquo; had already pointed out with
great acumen many of the more subtle beauties of Tennyson.</p>
<p>There are few more pleasant pages in this book than those
which record Tennyson&rsquo;s relations with another poet who was
blessed in his wife&mdash;Browning.&nbsp; Although the two poets
had previously met (notably in Paris in 1851), the intimacy
between them would seem to have been cemented, if not begun,
during one of Tennyson&rsquo;s visits to his and Browning&rsquo;s
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Knowles at the Hollies, Clapham
Common.&nbsp; Here Tennyson read to Browning the
&lsquo;Grail&rsquo; (which the latter pronounced to be
Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;best and highest&rdquo;); and here
Browning came and read his own new poem &lsquo;The Ring and the
Book,&rsquo; when Tennyson&rsquo;s verdict on it was, &ldquo;Full
of strange vigour and <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>remarkable in many ways, doubtful if
it will ever be popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The record of his long intimacy with Coventry Patmore and
Aubrey de Vere takes an important place in the biography, and the
reminiscences of Tennyson by the latter poet form an interesting
feature of the volumes.&nbsp; In George Meredith&rsquo;s first
little book Tennyson was delighted by the &lsquo;Love in a
Valley,&rsquo; and he had a full appreciation of the great
novelist all round.&nbsp; With the three leading poets of a
younger generation, Rossetti, William Morris, and Swinburne, he
had slight acquaintance.&nbsp; Here, however, is an interesting
memorandum by Tennyson recording his first meeting with
Swinburne:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may tell you, however, that young Swinburne called
here the other day with a college friend of his, and we asked him
to dinner, and I thought him a very modest and intelligent young
fellow.&nbsp; Moreover I read him what you vindicated
[&lsquo;Maud&rsquo;], but what I particularly admired in him was
that he did not press upon me any verses of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of contemporary novels he seems to have been a voracious and
indiscriminate reader.&nbsp; In the long list here given of
novelists whose books he read&mdash;good, bad, and
indifferent&mdash;it is curious not to find the name of Mrs.
Humphry Ward.&nbsp; With Thackeray he was intimate; and he was in
cordial relations with Dickens, Douglas Jerrold, and George
Eliot.&nbsp; Among <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the poets, besides Edward Fitzgerald
and Coventry Patmore, he saw much of William Allingham.&nbsp;
Though he admired parts of &lsquo;<i>Festus</i>&rsquo; greatly,
we do not gather from these volumes that he met the author.&nbsp;
Dobell he saw much of at Malvern in 1846.&nbsp; The letter-diary
from Tennyson during his stay in Cornwall with Holman Hunt, Val.
Prinsep, Woolner, and Palgrave, shows how exhilarated he could be
by wind and sea.&nbsp; The death of Lionel was a sad blow to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Demeter, and other Poems,&rsquo; was dedicated
to Lord Dufferin, &ldquo;as a tribute,&rdquo; says his son,
&ldquo;of affection and of gratitude; for words would fail me to
tell the unremitting kindness shown by himself and Lady Dufferin
to my brother Lionel during his fatal illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s critical insight could not fail to be good
when exercised upon poetry.&nbsp; Here are one or two of his
sayings about Burns, which show in what spirit he would have read
Henley&rsquo;s recent utterances about that poet:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burns did for the old songs of Scotland almost what
Shakespeare had done for the English drama that preceded
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the exquisite songs of Burns.&nbsp; In shape each
of them has the perfection of the berry, in light the radiance of
the dew-drop: you forget for its sake those stupid things his
serious poems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the reminiscences and impressions <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>of the poet
which Lord Tennyson has appended to his second volume, it is only
fair to specialize the admirable paper by F. T. Palgrave, which,
long as it is, is not by one word too long.&nbsp; That Jowett
would write wisely and well was in the nature of things.&nbsp;
The only contribution, however, we can quote here is
Froude&rsquo;s, for it is as brief as it is emphatic:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I owe to your father the first serious
reflexions upon life and the nature of it which have followed me
for more than fifty years.&nbsp; The same voice speaks to me now
as I come near my own end, from beyond the bar.&nbsp; Of the
early poems, &lsquo;Love and Death&rsquo; had the deepest effect
upon me.&nbsp; The same thought is in the last lines of the last
poems which we shall ever have from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father in my estimate, stands, and will stand far
away by the side of Shakespeare above all other English Poets,
with this relative superiority even to Shakespeare, that he
speaks the thoughts and speaks <i>to</i> the perplexities and
misgivings of his own age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was born at the fit time, before the world had grown
inflated with the vanity of Progress, and there was still an
atmosphere in which such a soul could grow.&nbsp; There will be
no such others for many a long age.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours gratefully,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">J. A. Froude</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter is striking evidence of the influence Tennyson had
upon his contemporaries.&nbsp; Comparisons, however, between
Shakespeare <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>and other poets can hardly be
satisfactory.&nbsp; A kinship between him and any other poet can
only be discovered in relation to one of the many sides of the
&ldquo;myriad-minded&rdquo; man.&nbsp; Where lies
Tennyson&rsquo;s kinship?&nbsp; Is it on the dramatic side?&nbsp;
In a certain sense Tennyson possessed dramatic power undoubtedly;
for he had a fine imagination of extraordinary vividness, and
could, as in &lsquo;Rizpah,&rsquo; make a character live in an
imagined situation.&nbsp; But to write a vital play requires more
than this: it requires a knowledge&mdash;partly instinctive and
partly acquired&mdash;of men as well as of man, and especially of
the way in which one individual acts and reacts upon another in
the complex web of human life.&nbsp; To depict the workings of
the soul of man in a given situation is one thing&mdash;to depict
the impact of ego upon ego is another.&nbsp; When we consider
that the more poetical a poet is the more oblivious we expect him
to be of the machinery of social life, it is no wonder that
poetical dramatists are so rare.&nbsp; In drama, even poetic
drama, the poet must leave the &ldquo;golden clime&rdquo; in
which he was born, must leave those &ldquo;golden stars
above&rdquo; in order to learn this machinery, and not only learn
it, but take a pleasure in learning it.</p>
<p>In honest admiration of Tennyson&rsquo;s dramatic work, where
it is admirable, we yield to none, at the time when &lsquo;The
Foresters&rsquo; was somewhat coldly accepted by the press on
account of <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>its &ldquo;lack of virility,&rdquo;
we considered that in the class to which it belonged, the scenic
pastoral plays, it held a very worthy place.&nbsp; That
Tennyson&rsquo;s admiration for Shakespeare was unbounded is
evident enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no one,&rdquo; says Jowett in his
recollections of Tennyson, &ldquo;to whom he was so absolutely
devoted, no poet of whom he had a more intimate knowledge than
Shakespeare.&nbsp; He said to me, and probably to many others,
that there was one intellectual process in the world of which he
could not even entertain an apprehension&mdash;that was the plays
of Shakespeare.&nbsp; He thought that he could instinctively
distinguish between the genuine and the spurious in them,
<i>e.g.</i>, between those parts of &lsquo;King Henry
VIII.,&rsquo; which are generally admitted to be spurious, and
those that are genuine.&nbsp; The same thought was partly working
in his mind on another occasion, when he spoke of two things,
which he conceived to be beyond the intelligence of man, and it
was certainly not repeated by him from any irreverence; the one,
the intellectual genius of Shakespeare&mdash;the other, the
religious genius of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the pathetic account of Tennyson&rsquo;s last moments
we find it recorded that on the Tuesday before the Wednesday on
which he died, he called out, &ldquo;Where is my
Shakespeare?&nbsp; I must have my Shakespeare&rdquo;; and again
on the day of his death, when the breath was passing out of his
body, he asked for his Shakespeare.&nbsp; <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>All this,
however, makes it the more remarkable that of poets Shakespeare
had the least influence upon Tennyson&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; There
was a fundamental unlikeness between the genius of the two
men.&nbsp; The only point in common between them is that each in
his own way captivated the suffrages both of the many and of the
fit though few, notwithstanding the fact that their methods of
dramatic approach in their plays are absolutely and fundamentally
different.&nbsp; Even their very methods of writing verse are
entirely different.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s blank verse seems at
its best to combine the beauties of the Miltonic and the
Wordsworthian line; while nothing is so rare in his work as a
Shakespearean line.&nbsp; Now and then such a line as</p>
<blockquote><p>Authority forgets a dying king</p>
</blockquote>
<p>turns up, but very rarely.&nbsp; We agree with all Professor
Jebb says in praise of Tennyson&rsquo;s blank verse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has known,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;how to modulate it
to every theme, and to elicit a music appropriate to each;
attuning it in turn to a tender and homely grace, as in
&lsquo;The Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter &lsquo;; to the severe and
ideal majesty of the antique, as in &lsquo;Tithonus&rsquo;; to
meditative thought, as in &lsquo;The Ancient Sage,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Akbar&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;; to pathetic or tragic tales of
contemporary life, as in &lsquo;Aylmer&rsquo;s Field,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Enoch Arden&rsquo;; or to sustained romance narrative, as
in the &lsquo;Idylls.&rsquo;&nbsp; No English poet has used blank
verse with such flexible variety, or <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>drawn from
it so large a compass of tones; nor has any maintained it so
equably on a high level of excellence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we fail to see where he touched Shakespeare on the
dramatic side of Shakespeare&rsquo;s immense genius.</p>
<p>Tennyson had the yearning common to all English poets to write
Shakespearean plays, and the filial piety with which his son
tries to uphold his father&rsquo;s claims as a dramatist is
beautiful; indeed, it is pathetic.&nbsp; But the greatest
injustice that can be done to a great poet is to claim for him
honours that do not belong to him.&nbsp; In his own line Tennyson
is supreme, and this book makes it necessary to ask once more
what that line is.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s stupendous fame has
for centuries been the candle into which all the various coloured
wings of later days have flown with more or less of
disaster.&nbsp; Though much was said in praise of
&lsquo;Harold&rsquo; by one of the most accomplished critics and
scholars of our time, Dr. Jebb, <a name="citation168"></a><a
href="#footnote168" class="citation">[168]</a> the play could not
keep the stage, nor does it live as a drama as any one of
Tennyson&rsquo;s lyrics can be said to live.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Becket,&rsquo; to be sure, was a success on the
stage.&nbsp; A letter to Tennyson in 1884 from so competent a
student of Shakespeare as Sir Henry Irving declares that
&lsquo;Becket&rsquo; is a finer play than &lsquo;King
John.&rsquo;&nbsp; Still, the &lsquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Lotos-Eaters,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter,&rsquo; outweigh the five-act tragedy
in the world of literary art.&nbsp; Of acted drama Tennyson knew
nothing at all.&nbsp; To him, evidently, the word <i>act</i> in a
printed play meant <i>chapter</i>; the word <i>scene</i> meant
<i>section</i>.&nbsp; In his early days he had gone occasionally
to see a play, and in 1875 he went to see Irving in Hamlet and
liked him better than Macready, whom he had seen in the
part.&nbsp; Still later he went to see Lady Archibald Campbell
act when &lsquo;Becket&rsquo; was given &ldquo;among the glades
of oak and fern in the Canizzaro Wood at Wimbledon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But handicapped as he was by ignorance of drama as a stage
product how could he write Shakespearean plays?</p>
<p>But let us for a moment consider the difference between the
two men as poets.&nbsp; It is hard to imagine the
master-dramatist of the world&mdash;it is hard to imagine the
poet who, by setting his foot upon allegory, saved our poetry
from drying up after the invasion of gongorism, euphuism, and
allegory&mdash;it is, we say, hard to imagine Shakespeare, if he
had conceived and written such lovely episodes as those of the
&lsquo;Idylls of the King,&rsquo; so full of concrete pictures,
setting about to turn his flesh-and-blood characters into
symbolic abstractions.&nbsp; There is in these volumes a curious
document, a memorandum of Tennyson&rsquo;s presented to Mr.
Knowles at Aldworth in 1869, in which an elaborate <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>scheme for turning into abstract ideas the characters
of the Arthurian story is sketched:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>K.A. Religious Faith.</p>
<p>King Arthur&rsquo;s three Guineveres.</p>
<p>The Lady of the Lake.</p>
<p>Two Guineveres, ye first prim Christianity.&nbsp; 2d Roman
Catholicism: ye first is put away and dwells apart, 2d Guinevere
flies.&nbsp; Arthur takes to the first again, but finds her
changed by lapse of Time.</p>
<p>Modred, the sceptical understanding.&nbsp; He pulls Guinevere,
Arthur&rsquo;s latest wife, from the throne.</p>
<p>Merlin Emrys, the Enchanter.&nbsp; Science.&nbsp; Marries his
daughter to Modred.</p>
<p>Excalibur, War.</p>
<p>The Sea, the people / The Saxons, the people } the S. are a
sea-people and it is theirs and a type of them.</p>
<p>The Round Table: liberal institutions.</p>
<p>Battle of Camlan.</p>
<p>2d Guinevere with the enchanted book and cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Knowles in a letter to the biographer says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He encouraged me to write a short paper, in the form of
a letter to <i>The Spectator</i>, on the inner meaning of the
whole poem, which I did, simply upon the lines he himself
indicated.&nbsp; He often said, however, that an allegory should
never be pressed too far.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are all the lovely
passages of human passion and human pathos in these
&lsquo;Idylls&rsquo; allegorical&mdash;that is to
say&mdash;make-believe?&nbsp; The reason why allegorical poetry
is always second-rate, even at its best, is that it flatters the
reader&rsquo;s intellect at the expense of his heart.&nbsp; Fancy
&ldquo;the allegorical intent&rdquo; behind the parting of Hector
and Andromache, and behind the death <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of
Desdemona!&nbsp; Thank Heaven, however, Tennyson&rsquo;s
allegorical intent was a destructive afterthought.&nbsp; For,
says the biographer, &ldquo;the allegorical drift here marked out
was fundamentally changed in the later schemes in the
&lsquo;Idylls.&rsquo;&rdquo; According to that delicate critic,
Canon Ainger, there is a symbolical intent underlying &lsquo;The
Lady of Shalott&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new-born love for something, for some one in the
wide world from whom she has been so long secluded, takes her out
of the region of shadows into that of realities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what concerns us here is the fact that when Shakespeare
wrote, although he yielded too much now and then to the passion
for gongorism and euphuism which had spread all over Europe, it
was against the nature of his genius to be influenced by the
contemporary passion for allegory.&nbsp; That he had a natural
dislike of allegorical treatment of a subject is evident, not
only in his plays, but in his sonnets.&nbsp; At a time when the
sonnet was treated as the special vehicle for allegory,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets were the direct outcome of emotion of
the most intimate and personal kind&mdash;a fact which at once
destroys the ignorant drivel about the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, for what Bacon had was fancy, not
imagination, and Fancy is the mother of Allegory, Imagination is
the mother of Drama.&nbsp; The moment that <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Bacon
essayed imaginative work, he passed into allegory, as we see in
the &lsquo;New Atlantis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It might, perhaps, be said that there are three kinds of
poetical temperament which have never yet been found equally
combined in any one poet&mdash;not even in Shakespeare
himself.&nbsp; There is the lyric temperament, as exemplified in
writers like Sappho, Shelley, and others; there is the meditative
temperament&mdash;sometimes speculative, but not always
accompanied by metaphysical dreaming&mdash;as exemplified in
Lucretius, Wordsworth, and others; and there is the dramatic
temperament, as exemplified in Homer, &AElig;schylus, Sophocles,
and Shakespeare.&nbsp; In a certain sense the Iliad is the most
dramatic poem in the world, for the dramatic picture lives
undisturbed by lyrism or meditation.&nbsp; In &AElig;schylus and
Sophocles we find, besides the dramatic temperament, a large
amount of the lyrical temperament, and a large amount of the
meditative, but unaccompanied by metaphysical speculation.&nbsp;
In Shakespeare we find, besides the dramatic temperament, a large
amount of the meditative accompanied by an irresistible impulse
towards metaphysical speculation, but, on the whole, a moderate
endowment of the lyrical temperament, judging by the few
occasions on which he exercised it.&nbsp; For fine as are such
lyrics as &ldquo;Hark, hark, the lark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where the
bee sucks,&rdquo; &amp;c., other poets have written lyrics as
fine.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>In a certain sense no man can be a pure and perfect
dramatist.&nbsp; Every ego is a central sun found which the
universe revolves, and it must needs assert itself.&nbsp; This is
why on a previous occasion, when speaking of the way in which
thoughts are interjected into drama by the Greek dramatists, we
said that really and truly no man can paint another, but only
himself, and what we call character-painting is at the best but a
poor mixing of painter and painted&mdash;a third something
between these two, just as what we call colour and sound are born
of the play of undulation upon organism.&nbsp; Very likely this
is putting the case too strongly.&nbsp; But be this as it may, it
is impossible to open a play of Shakespeare&rsquo;s without being
struck with the way in which the meditative side of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s mind strove with and sometimes nearly
strangled the dramatic.&nbsp; If this were confined to
&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; where the play seems meant to revolve on a
philosophical pivot, it would not be so remarkable.&nbsp; But so
hindered with thoughts, reflections, meditations, and
metaphysical speculations was Shakespeare that he tossed them
indiscriminately into other plays, tragedies, comedies, and
histories, regardless sometimes of the character who uttered
them.&nbsp; With regard to metaphysical speculation, indeed, even
when he was at work on the busiest scenes of his dramas, it would
seem&mdash;as was said on the occasion before alluded
to&mdash;that Shakespeare&rsquo;s <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>instinct
for actualizing and embodying in concrete form the dreams of the
metaphysician often arose and baffled him.&nbsp; It would seem
that when writing a comedy he could not help putting into the
mouth of a man like Claudio those words which seem as if they
ought to have been spoken by a metaphysician of the Hamlet type,
beginning,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ay, but to die and go we know not where.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would seem that he could not help putting into the mouth of
Macbeth those words which also seem as if they ought to have been
spoken on the platform at Elsinore, beginning,</p>
<blockquote><p>To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if it be said that Macbeth was a philosopher as well as a
murderer, and might have thought these thoughts in the terrible
strait in which he then was, surely nothing but this marvellous
peculiarity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s temperament will explain his
making Macbeth stop at Duncan&rsquo;s bedroom door, dagger in
hand, to say,</p>
<blockquote><p>Now o&rsquo;er the one half world Nature seems
dead, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, though Prospero was very likely a philosopher too,
even he steals from Hamlet&rsquo;s mouth such words of the
metaphysician as these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are such
stuff<br />
As dreams are made on, and our little life<br />
Is rounded with a sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this is one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most striking
characteristics will not be denied by any competent student of
his works.&nbsp; Nor will <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>any such
student deny that, exquisite as his lyrics are, they are too few
and too unimportant in subject-matter to set beside his supreme
wealth of dramatic picture, and his wide vision as a thinker and
a metaphysical dreamer.</p>
<p>Now on which of these sides of Shakespeare does Tennyson
touch?&nbsp; Is it on the lyrical side?&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
fine lyrics are so few that they would be lost if set beside the
marvellous wealth of Tennyson&rsquo;s lyrical work.&nbsp; On one
side only of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius Tennyson touches,
perhaps, more closely than any subsequent poet.&nbsp; As a
metaphysician none comes so near Shakespeare as he who wrote
these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more, my son! for more than
once when I<br />
Sat all alone, revolving in myself<br />
The word that is the symbol of myself,<br />
The mortal limit of the Self was loosed,<br />
And passed into the Nameless, as a cloud<br />
Melts into Heaven.&nbsp; I touch&rsquo;d my limbs, the limbs<br
/>
Were strange not mine&mdash;and yet no shade of doubt,<br />
But utter clearness, and thro&rsquo; loss of Self.<br />
The gain of such large life as match&rsquo;d with ours<br />
Were Sun to spark&mdash;unshadowable in words,<br />
Themselves but shadows of a shadow-world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, seems to be the truth of the matter: while
Shakespeare had immense dramatic power, and immense meditative
power with moderate lyric power, Tennyson had the lyric gift and
the meditative gift without the dramatic.&nbsp; His poems are
more full of reflections, meditations, and generalizations upon
human life than any poet&rsquo;s since Shakespeare.&nbsp; But
then the moment <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>that Shakespeare descended from
those heights whether his metaphysical imagination had borne him,
he became, not a lyrist, as Tennyson became, but a
dramatist.&nbsp; And this divides Shakespeare as far from
Tennyson as it divides him from any other first-class
writer.&nbsp; We admirers of Tennyson must content ourselves with
this thought, that, wonderful as it is for Shakespeare to have
combined great metaphysical power with supreme power as a
dramatist, it is scarcely less wonderful for Tennyson to have
combined great metaphysical power with the power of a supreme
lyrist.&nbsp; Nay, is it not in a certain sense more wonderful
for a lyrical impulse such as Tennyson&rsquo;s to be found
combined with a power of philosophical and metaphysical
abstraction such as he shows in some of his poems?</p>

<p>Although the noble poet and high-souled woman we have just
lost had been ill and suffering from grievous pain for a long
time, Death came at last with a soft hand which could but make
him welcome.&nbsp; Since early in August, when she took to her
bed, she was so extremely weak and otherwise ill that one
scarcely expected her (at any time) to live more than a month or
so, and for the last six weeks or thereabouts&mdash;say from the
15th of November&mdash;one expected her to die almost from day to
day.&nbsp; My dear friend William Rossetti, who used to go to
Torrington Square every afternoon, saw her on the afternoon of
December 28th [1894].&nbsp; He did not, he told me, much expect
to find her alive in the afternoon of the 29th, and intended,
therefore, to make his next call earlier.&nbsp; She died at
half-past seven in the morning of the 29th, in the presence only
of her faithful nurse Mrs. Read.&nbsp; It was through her sudden
collapse that she missed at her side, <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>when she
passed away, that brother whose whole life has been one of
devotion to his family, and whose tireless affection for the last
of them was one of the few links that bound Christina&rsquo;s
sympathy to the earth.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Her illness was of a most complicated kind: two years and a
half ago she was operated on for cancer: functional malady of the
heart, accompanied by dropsy in the left arm and hand,
followed.&nbsp; Although on Friday the serious symptoms of her
case became, as I have said, accentuated, she was throughout the
day and night entirely conscious; and so peaceful and apparently
so free from pain was she that neither the medical man nor the
nurse supposed the end to be quite so near as it was.&nbsp;
During all this time, up to the moment of actual dissolution, her
lips seemed to be moving in prayer, but, of course, this with her
was no uncommon sign: duty and prayer ordered her life.&nbsp; Her
sufferings, I say, had been great, but they had been encountered
by a fortitude that was greater still.&nbsp; Throughout all her
life, indeed, she was the most notable example that our time has
produced of the masterful power of man&rsquo;s spiritual nature
when at its highest to conquer in its warfare with earthly
conditions, as her brother Gabriel&rsquo;s life was the most
notable example of the struggle of the spiritual nature with the
bodily when the two are equally equipped.&nbsp; It is the
conviction of one whose <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>high
privilege it was to know her in many a passage of sorrow and
trial that of all the poets who have lived and died within our
time, Christina Rossetti must have had the noblest soul.</p>
<p>A certain irritability of temper, which was, perhaps, natural
to her, had, when I first became acquainted with her family
(about 1872), been overcome, or at least greatly chastened, by
religion (which with her was a passion) and by a large
acquaintance with grief, resulting in a long meditation over the
mystery of pain.&nbsp; In wordly matters her generosity may be
described as boundless; but perhaps it is not difficult for a
poet to be generous in a worldly sense&mdash;to be free in
parting with that which can be precious only to commonplace
souls.&nbsp; What, however, is not so easy is for one holding
such strong religious convictions as Christina Rossetti held to
cherish such generous thoughts and feelings as were hers about
those to whom her shibboleths meant nothing.&nbsp; This was what
made her life so beautiful and such a blessing to all.&nbsp; The
indurating effects of a selfish religiosity never withered her
soul nor narrowed it.&nbsp; With her, indeed, religion was very
love&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A largess universal like the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is always futile to make guesses as to what might have been
the development of a poet&rsquo;s genius and character had the
education of <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>circumstances been different from
what it was, and perhaps it is specially futile to guess what
would have been the development under other circumstances of her,
the poet of whom her friends used to speak with affection and
reverence as &ldquo;Christina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the death of her brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti (or as his
friends used to call him Gabriel) in 1882, I gave that sketch of
the family story which has formed the basis of most of the
biographical notices of him and his family; it would, therefore,
be superfluous to reiterate what I said and what is now matter of
familiar knowledge.&nbsp; It may, however, be as well to remind
the reader that, owing to the peculiar position in London of the
father Gabriele Rossetti, the family were during childhood and
partly during youth as much isolated from the outer English world
as were the family between whom and themselves there were many
points of resemblance&mdash;the Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; The two among
them who were not in youth of a retiring disposition were he who
afterwards became the most retiring of all, Gabriel, and Maria,
the latter of whom was in one sense retiring, and in another
expansive.&nbsp; In her dark brown, or, as some called them,
black eyes, there would suddenly come up and shine an enthusiasm,
a capacity of poetic and romantic fire, to the quelling of which
there must have gone an immensity of religious force.&nbsp; <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>As to Gabriel, during a large portion of his splendid
youth he exhibited a genial breadth of front that affined him to
Shakespeare and Walter Scott.&nbsp; The English strain in the
family found expression in him, and in him alone.&nbsp; There was
a something in the hearty ring of his voice that drew Englishmen
to him as by a magnet.</p>
<p>While it was but little that the others drew from the rich
soil of merry England, he drew from it half at least of his
radiant personality&mdash;half at least of his incomparable
genius.&nbsp; Though he was in every way part and parcel of that
marvellous little family circle of children of genius in
Charlotte Street, he had also the power of looking at it from the
outside.&nbsp; It would be strange, indeed, if this or any other
power should be found lacking in him.&nbsp; I have often heard
Rossetti&mdash;by the red flicker of the studio fire, when the
gas was turned down to save his eyesight&mdash;give the most
graphic and fascinating descriptions of the little group and the
way in which they grew up to be what they were under the tuition
of a father whose career can only be called romantic, and a
mother whose intellectual gifts were so remarkable that, had they
not been in some great degree stifled by the exercise of an
entire self-abnegation on behalf of her family, she, too, must
have become an important figure in literature.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The father died in 1854, many years before <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>I knew the
family; but Gabriel&rsquo;s description of him; his conversations
with his brother-refugees and others who visited the
house&mdash;conversations in which the dreamy and the
matter-of-fact were oddly blent; his striking skill as an
improvisatore of Italian poetry, and also as a master of
pen-and-ink drawing; his great musical gift&mdash;a gift which
none of his family seemed to have inherited; his fine tenor
voice; his unflinching courage and independence of character
(qualities which made him refuse, in a Protestant country, to
make open abjuration of the creed in which the Rossettis had been
reared, though he detested the Pope and all his works, and was,
if not an actual freethinker, thoroughly
latitudinarian)&mdash;Gabriel&rsquo;s pictures of this poet and
father of poets were so vivid&mdash;so amazingly and incredibly
vivid&mdash;that I find it difficult to think I never met the
father in the flesh: not unfrequently I find myself talking of
him as if I had known him.&nbsp; What higher tribute than this
can be made to a narrator&rsquo;s dramatic power?&nbsp; Those who
have seen the elder Rossetti&rsquo;s pen-and-ink drawings (the
work of a child) will agree with me that Gabriel did not
over-estimate them in the least degree.&nbsp; All the Rossettis
inherited from their father voices so musical that they could be
recognized among other voices in any gathering, and no doubt that
clear-cut method of syllabification which was so marked a
characteristic <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of Christina&rsquo;s conversation,
but which gave it a sort of foreign tone, was inherited from the
father.&nbsp; Her affinity to the other two members of the family
was seen in that intense sense of duty of which Gabriel, with all
his generosity, had but little.&nbsp; There was no martyrdom she
would not have undertaken if she thought that duty called upon
her to undertake it, and this may be said of the other two.</p>
<p>In most things, however, Christina Rossetti seemed to stand
midway between Gabriel and the other two members of her family,
and it was the same in physical matters.&nbsp; She had
Gabriel&rsquo;s eyes, in which hazel and blue-grey were
marvellously blent, one hue shifting into the other, answering to
the movements of the thoughts&mdash;eyes like the
mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And her brown hair, though less warm in
colour than his during his boyhood, was still like it.&nbsp; When
a young girl, at the time that she sat for the Virgin in the
picture now in the National Gallery, she was, as both her mother
and Gabriel have told me, really lovely, with an extraordinary
expression of pensive sweetness.&nbsp; She used to have in the
little back parlour a portrait of herself at eighteen by Gabriel,
which gives all these qualities.&nbsp; Even then, however, the
fullness in the eyes was somewhat excessive.&nbsp; Afterwards her
ill health took a peculiar form, the effect of which was that the
eyes were, in a manner of speaking, pushed <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>forward,
and although this protuberance was never disagreeable, it
certainly took a good deal of beauty from her face.</p>
<p>Dominant, however, as was the father&rsquo;s personality among
his friends, the mother&rsquo;s influence upon the children was
stronger than his; and no wonder, for I think there was no
beautiful charm of woman that Mrs. Rossetti lacked.&nbsp; She did
not seem at all aware that she was a woman of exceptional gifts,
yet her intellectual penetration and the curious exactitude of
her knowledge were so remarkable that Gabriel accepted her dicta
as oracles not to be challenged.&nbsp; One of her specialities
was the pronunciation of English words, in which she was an
authority.&nbsp; I cannot resist giving one little instance, as
it illustrates a sweet feature of Gabriel&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; It occurred on a lovely summer&rsquo;s day in
the old Kelmscott manor house in 1873, when Mrs. Rossetti,
Christina, and myself were watching Gabriel at work upon
&lsquo;Proserpine.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had pronounced the word
<i>aspirant</i> with the accent upon the middle syllable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pardon me, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, without looking
from his work, &ldquo;that word should be pronounced with the
accent on the first syllable, as a purist like you ought to
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my challenging this, he said, in a tone
which was meant to show that he was saying the last word upon the
subject, &ldquo;My mother always says <i>&aacute;spirant</i>, and
she is always right upon <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>matters of
pronunciation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I shall always say
<i>&aacute;spirant</i>,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; And I may add
that I now do say <i>&aacute;spirant</i>, and, right or wrong,
intend to say <i>&aacute;spirant</i> so long as this breath of
mine enables me to say <i>&aacute;spirant</i> at all.&nbsp;
Afterwards Christina, as we were strolling by the weir, watching
Gabriel and George Hake pounding across the meadows at the rate
of five miles an hour, said to me, &ldquo;I think you were right
about <i>asp&iacute;rant</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;it is a dear, old-fashioned way.&nbsp; Your mother
says <i>&aacute;spirant</i>; I now remember that my own mother
said <i>&aacute;spirant</i>.&nbsp; I shall stick to
<i>&aacute;spirant</i> till the end of the chapter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Christina said, &ldquo;Then so will I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among Mrs. Rossetti&rsquo;s accomplishments was reading aloud,
mainly from imaginative writers, and I cannot recall without a
thrill of mingled emotions a delightful stay of mine at Kelmscott
in the summer of &rsquo;73, when she, whose age then was
seventy-three, used to read out to us all sorts of things.&nbsp;
And writing these words makes me hear those readings
again&mdash;makes me hear, through the open casement of the
quaint old house, the blackbirds from the home field trying in
vain to rival the music of that half-Italian, half-English
voice.&nbsp; To have been admitted into such a charmed circle I
look upon as one of the greatest privileges of my life.&nbsp; It
is something for a man to have lived within touch of Christina
Rossetti and her mother.&nbsp; <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>From her
father, however, Christina took, either by the operation of some
law of heredity or from early association with the author of
&lsquo;Il Mistero dell&rsquo; Amor Platonico del Medio Evo&rsquo;
and &lsquo;La Beatrice di Dante,&rsquo; that passion for
symbolism which is one of the chief features of her poetry.&nbsp;
There is, perhaps, no more striking instance of the inscrutable
lines in which ancestral characteristics descend than the way in
which the passion for symbolism was inherited by Christina and
Gabriel Rossetti from their father.</p>
<p>While Christina&rsquo;s poetical work may be described as
being all symbolical, she was not much given, like her brother,
to read symbols into the every-day incidents of life.&nbsp;
Gabriel, on the contrary, though using symbolism in his poetry in
only a moderate degree, allowed his instinct for symbolizing his
own life to pass into positive superstition.&nbsp; When a party
of us&mdash;including Mrs. Rossetti, Christina, the two aunts,
Dr. Hake, with four of his sons, and myself&mdash;were staying
for Christmas with Gabriel near Bognor, a tree fell in the garden
during a storm.&nbsp; While Gabriel seemed inclined to take it as
a sign of future disaster, Christina, whose poetry is so full of
symbolism, would smile at such a notion.&nbsp; Yet Gabriel could
speak of his father&rsquo;s symbolizing (as in &lsquo;La Beatrice
di Dante&rsquo;) as being absolutely and hopelessly eccentric and
worthless.&nbsp; This is <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>remarkable,
for one would have thought that it was impossible to read those
extraordinary works of the elder Rossetti&rsquo;s without being
impressed by the rare intellectual subtlety of the Italian
scholar.</p>
<p>Of course the opportunities of brother and sister of studying
Nature were identical.&nbsp; Both were born in London, and during
childhood saw Nature only as a holiday scene.&nbsp; Christina
would talk with delight of her grandfather&rsquo;s cottage
retreat about thirty miles from London, to which she used to go
for a holiday in a stage coach, and of the beauty of the country
around.&nbsp; But these expeditions were not numerous, and came
to an end when she was a child of seven or eight, and it was very
little that she saw outside London before girlhood was
past.&nbsp; I have myself heard her speak of what she has
somewhere written about&mdash;the rapture of the sight of some
primroses growing in a railway cutting.&nbsp; It is, of course, a
great disadvantage to any poet not to have been born in the
country; learned in Nature the city-born poet can never be, as we
see in the case of Milton, who loved Nature without knowing
her.&nbsp; It is here that Jean Ingelow has such an advantage
over Christina Rossetti.&nbsp; Her love of flowers, and birds,
and trees, and all that makes the earth so beautiful, is not one
whit stronger than Christina&rsquo;s own, but it is a love born
of an exhaustive detailed knowledge of Nature&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>On a certain occasion when walking with a friend at
Hunter&rsquo;s Forestall, near Herne Bay, where she and her
mother were nursing Gabriel through one of his illnesses, the
talk ran upon Shelley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Skylark,&rsquo; a poem which
she adored.&nbsp; She was literally bewildered because the friend
showed that he was able to tell, from a certain change of sound
in the note of a skylark that had risen over the lane, the moment
when the bird had made up its mind to cease singing and return to
the earth.&nbsp; It seemed to her an almost supernatural gift,
and yet an ignorant ploughman will often be able to do the same
thing.&nbsp; This kind of intimacy with Nature she coveted.&nbsp;
With the lower animals, nevertheless, she had a strange kind of
sympathy of her own.&nbsp; Young creatures especially understood
the playful humour of her approach.&nbsp; A delightful fantastic
whim was the bond between her and puppies and kittens and
birds.&nbsp; Her intimacy with Nature&mdash;of a different kind
altogether from that of Wordsworth and Tennyson&mdash;was of the
kind that I have described on a previous occasion as Sufeyistic:
she loved the beauty of this world, but not entirely for itself;
she loved it on account of its symbols of another world
beyond.&nbsp; And yet she was no slave to the ascetic side of
Christianity.&nbsp; No doubt there was mixed with her
spiritualism, or perhaps underlying it, a rich sensuousness that
under other circumstances <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>of life
would have made itself manifest, and also a rare potentiality of
deep passion.&nbsp; It is this, indeed, which makes the study of
her great and noble nature so absorbing.</p>
<p>Perhaps for strength both of subject and of treatment,
Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s masterpiece is &lsquo;Amor
Mundi.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here we get a lesson of human life expressed,
not didactically, but in a concrete form of unsurpassable
strength, harmony, and concision.&nbsp; Indeed, it may be said of
her work generally that her strength as an artist is seen not so
much in mastery over the rhythm, or even over the verbal texture
of poetry, as in the skill with which she expresses an
allegorical intent by subtle suggestion instead of direct
preachment.&nbsp; Herein &lsquo;An Apple Gathering&rsquo; is
quite perfect.&nbsp; It is, however, if I may venture to say so,
a mistake to speak of Christina Rossetti as being a great poetic
artist.&nbsp; Exquisite as her best things are, no one had a more
uncertain hand than she when at work.&nbsp; Here, as in so many
things, she was like Blake, whose influence upon her was very
great.</p>
<p>Of self-criticism she had almost nothing.&nbsp; On one
occasion, many years ago now, she expressed a wish to have some
of her verses printed in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, and I
suggested her sending them to 16, Cheyne Walk, her
brother&rsquo;s house, where I then used to spend much time in a
study that I occupied there.&nbsp; I said that her brother and I
would read them together and <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>submit them
to the editor.&nbsp; She sent several poems (I think about six),
not one of which was in the least degree worthy of her.&nbsp;
This naturally embarrassed me, but Gabriel, who entirely shared
my opinion of the poems, wrote at once to her and told her that
the verses sent were, both in his own judgment and mine, unworthy
of her, and that she &ldquo;had better buckle to at once and
write another poem.&rdquo;&nbsp; She did so, and the result was
an exquisite lyric which appeared in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; Here is where she was wonderfully
unlike Gabriel, whose power of self-criticism in poetry was
almost as great as Tennyson&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; But in the matter
of inspiration she was, I must think, above Gabriel&mdash;above
almost everybody.</p>
<p>If English rhymed metres had been as easy to work in as
Italian rhymed metres, her imagination was so vivid, her poetic
impulse was so strong, and, indeed, her poetic wealth so
inexhaustible, that she would have stood in the front rank of
English poets.&nbsp; But the writer of English rhymed measures is
in a very different position as regards improvisatorial efforts
from the Italian who writes in rhymed measures.&nbsp; He has to
grapple with the metrical structure&mdash;to seize the form by
the throat, as it were, and force it to take in the enormous
wealth at the English poet&rsquo;s command.&nbsp; Fine as is the
&lsquo;Prince&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; for instance (and it would
be hard to <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>find its superior in regard to
poetic material in the whole compass of Victorian poetry), the
number of rugged lines the reader has to encounter weighs upon
and distresses him until, indeed, the conclusion is reached: then
the passion and the pathos of the subject cause the poem to rise
upon billows of true rhythm.&nbsp; On the other hand, however, it
may be said that a special quality of her verse is a <i>curiosa
felicitas</i> which makes a metrical blemish tell as a kind of
suggestive grace.&nbsp; But I must stop; I must bear in mind that
he who has walked and talked with Christina Rossetti, burdened
with a wealth of remembered beauty from earth and heaven, runs
the risk of becoming garrulous.</p>
<h3><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>II.</h3>
<p>In regard to unpublished manuscripts which a writer has left
behind him, the responsibilities of his legal representatives are
far more grave than seems to be generally supposed.&nbsp; In
deciding what posthumous writings an executor is justified in
giving to the public it is important, of course, to take into
account the character, the idiosyncrasy of the writer in regard
to all his relations towards what may be called the mechanism of
every-day life.&nbsp; Some poets are so methodical that the mere
fact of anything having been left by them in manuscript
unaccompanied by directions as to its disposal is <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> evidence that it was intended to be withheld from the
public, either temporarily for revision or finally and
absolutely.&nbsp; And, of course, the representative, especially
if he is also a relative or a friend, has to consider primarily
the intentions of the dead.&nbsp; If loyalty to living friends is
a duty, what shall be said of loyalty to friends who are
dead?&nbsp; This, indeed, has a sanction of the deepest religious
kind.</p>
<p>No doubt, in the philosophical sense, the aspiration of the
dead artist for perfect work and the honour it brings is a
delusion, a sweet <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>mockery of the fancy.&nbsp; But then
so is every other aspiration which soars above the warm circle of
the human affections, and if this delusion of the dead artist was
held worthy of respect during the artist&rsquo;s life, it is
worthy of respect&mdash;nay, it is worthy of
reverence&mdash;after he is dead.&nbsp; Now every true artist
when at work has before him an ideal which he would fain reach,
or at least approach, and if he does not himself know whether in
any given exercise he has reached that ideal or neared it, we may
be pretty sure that no one else does.&nbsp; Hence, whenever there
is apparent in the circumstances under which the MS. has been
found the slightest indication that the writer did not wish it to
be given to the public, the representative who ignores this
indication sins against that reverence for the dead which in all
forms of civilization declares itself to be one of the deepest
instincts of man.</p>
<p>That the instinct we are speaking of is really one of the
primal instincts is the very first fact that arch&aelig;ology
vouches for.&nbsp; Of many lost races, such as the Aztecs and
Toltecs, for instance, we have no historical traces save those
which are furnished by testimonials of their reverence for the
dead.&nbsp; But that this fine instinct is now dying out in the
Western world&mdash;that it will soon be eliminated from the
human constitution of races that are generally considered to be
the most advanced&mdash;is made <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>manifest by
the present attitude of England and America towards their
illustrious dead.&nbsp; In the literary arena of both countries,
indeed, so entire is the abrogation of this most beautiful of all
feelings&mdash;so recklessly and so shamefully are not only raw
manuscripts, but private letters, put up to auction for
publication&mdash;that at last the great writers of our time,
confronted by this new terror, are wisely beginning to take care
of themselves and their friends by a holocaust of every scrap of
paper lying in their desks.</p>
<p>So demoralized has the literary world become by the present
craze for notoriety and for personal details of prominent men
that an executor who in regard to the disposal of his
testator&rsquo;s money would act with the most rigid
scrupulousness will, in regard to the MSS. he finds in his
testator&rsquo;s desk, commit, &ldquo;for the benefit of the
public,&rdquo; an outrage that would have made the men of a less
vulgar period shudder.&nbsp; The &ldquo;benefit of the
public,&rdquo; indeed!&nbsp; Who is this &ldquo;public,&rdquo;
and what are its rights as against the rights of the dead poet,
whose heartstrings are woven into &ldquo;copy&rdquo; by the
disloyal friend he trusted?&nbsp; The inherent callousness of
man&rsquo;s nature is never so painfully seen as in the relation
of this ogre, &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; to dead genius.&nbsp;
Without the smallest real reverence for genius&mdash;without the
smallest capacity of distinguishing the poetaster it <!-- page
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>always adores from the true poet it always
ignores&mdash;the public can still fall down before the pedestal
upon which genius has been placed by the select few&mdash;fall
down with its long ears wide open for gossip about genius, or
anything else that is talked about.</p>
<p>It was with such thoughts as these that we opened the present
somewhat bulky volume <a name="citation195"></a><a
href="#footnote195" class="citation">[195]</a>&mdash;not,
however, with many misgivings; for Christina Rossetti, before she
made her brother executor, knew what were his views as to the
rights of the public as against the rights of genius.&nbsp; And
if he has printed here every poem he could lay hands upon, he may
fairly be assumed to have done so with the consent of a sister
whom he loved so dearly and by whom he was so dearly loved.&nbsp;
Fortunately there are not many of these relics that are devoid of
a deep interest, some from the biographical point of view, some
from the poetical.</p>
<p>Again, what is to be said about such part of a dead
author&rsquo;s writing as, having appeared in print, has
afterwards passed through the author&rsquo;s crucible of artistic
revision?&nbsp; What about the executor&rsquo;s duty here, where
the case between the author and the public stands on a different
footing?&nbsp; At the present time, when newspapers and novels
alone are read, it is not the poet&rsquo;s verses which most
people read, but <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>paragraphs about what the author and
his wife and children &ldquo;eat and drink and avoid&rdquo;: a
time when, if the poet&rsquo;s verses are read at all, it is the
accidents rather than the essentials of the work that seem
primarily to concern the public.&nbsp; At such a time an editor
is not entirely master of his actions.&nbsp; Doubtless, there is
much reason in the wrath of Tennyson and other great poets
against the &ldquo;literary resurrection man,&rdquo; who, though
incapable of understanding the beauties of a beautiful work, can
take a very great interest in poring over the various stages
through which that work has passed on its way to
perfection.&nbsp; These poets, however, are apt to forget that,
after a poem or line has once passed into print, its final
suppression is impossible.&nbsp; And perhaps there are other
reasons why, in this matter, an editor should be allowed some
indulgence.</p>
<p>Here, for instance, is a puzzling case to be tried <i>in foro
conscienti&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; In the first edition of
&lsquo;Goblin Market,&rsquo; published in 1862, appeared three
poems of more breadth of treatment than any of the others:
&lsquo;Cousin Kate,&rsquo; a ballad, &lsquo;Sister Maude,&rsquo;
a ballad, and &lsquo;A Triad,&rsquo; a sonnet.&nbsp; In
subsequent issues of the book these were all omitted.&nbsp; Mr.
W. M. Rossetti, speaking of &lsquo;Sister Maude,&rsquo; says:
&ldquo;I presume that my sister, with overstrained scrupulosity,
considered its moral tone to be somewhat open to exception.&nbsp;
In such a view I by no means <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>agree, and
I therefore reproduce it.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Christina&rsquo;s
objection was valid when she raised it, it is, of course, valid
now, when the beloved poet is in the &ldquo;country beyond
Orion,&rdquo; and knows what sanctions are of man&rsquo;s
imagining, and what sanctions are more eternal than the movements
of the stars.</p>
<p>The question here is, What were Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s
wishes? not whether her brother &ldquo;agrees&rdquo; with
them.&nbsp; Hence, if it were not certain that some one would
soon have restored them, would Mr. W. M. Rossetti have hesitated
before doing so?&nbsp; For they are among the most powerful
things Christina Rossetti ever wrote, and it was a subject of
deep regret to her friends that she suppressed them.&nbsp; Yet
she withdrew them from conscientious motives.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Sister Maude&rsquo; she showed how great was her power in
the most difficult of all forms of poetic art&mdash;the romantic
ballad.&nbsp; Splendid as are Gabriel Rossetti&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sister Helen&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rose Mary,&rsquo; the
literary <i>aura</i> surrounding them prevents them from
seeming&mdash;as the best of the Border ballads
seem&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s very voice muttering in her dreams of
the pathos and the mystery of the human story.&nbsp; It was not,
perhaps, given even to Rossetti to get very near to that supreme
old poet (not forgotten, because never known) who wrote
&ldquo;May Margaret&rsquo;s&rdquo; appeal to the ghost of her
lover Clerk Saunders:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Is there ony room at your head,
Saunders?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there ony room at your feet?<br />
Is there ony room at your side, Saunders,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where fain, fain I wad sleep?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the very imperfections of the rhymes seem somehow to add
to the pathos and the mystery of the chant.&nbsp; But if, indeed,
it has been given to any modern poet to get into this atmosphere,
it has been given to Christina Rossetti.&nbsp; And so with the
ballad of simple human passion no modern writer has quite done
what Christina Rossetti has done in one of the poems here
restored:&mdash;</p>
<h4>SISTER MAUDE.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Who told my mother of my shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who told my father of my dear?<br />
Oh who but Maude, my sister Maude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lurked to spy and peer.</p>
<p>Cold he lies, as cold as stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his clotted curls about his face:<br />
The comeliest corpse in all the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And worthy of a queen&rsquo;s embrace.</p>
<p>You might have spared his soul, sister,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have spared my soul, your own soul too:<br />
Though I had not been born at all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d never have looked at you.</p>
<p>My father may sleep in Paradise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother at Heaven-gate:<br />
But sister Maude shall get no sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Either early or late.</p>
<p>My father may wear a golden gown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother a crown may win;<br />
If my dear and I knocked at Heaven-gate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps they&rsquo;d let us in:<br />
But sister Maude, O sister Maude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bide <i>you</i> with death and sin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>But it is for the personal poems that this volume will
be prized most dearly by certain readers.</p>
<p>Mr. W. M. Rossetti speaks of &ldquo;the very wide and
exceedingly strong outburst of eulogy&rdquo; of his sister which
appeared in the public press after her death.&nbsp; Yet that
outburst was far from giving adequate expression to what was felt
by some of her readers&mdash;those between whom and herself there
was a bond of sympathy so sacred and so deep as to be something
like a religion.&nbsp; It is not merely that she was the
acknowledged queen in that world (outside the arena called
&ldquo;the literary world&rdquo;) where poetry is &ldquo;its own
exceeding great reward,&rdquo; but to other readers of a
different kind altogether&mdash;readers who, drawing the deepest
delight from such poetry as specially appeals to them, never read
any other, and have but small knowledge of poetry as a fine
art&mdash;her verse was, perhaps, more precious still.&nbsp; They
feel that at every page of her writing the beautiful poetry is
only the outcome of a life whose almost unexampled beauty
fascinates them.</p>
<p>Although Christina Rossetti had more of what is called the
unconsciousness of poetic inspiration than any other poet of her
time, the writing of poetry was not by any means the chief
business of her life.&nbsp; She was too thorough a poet for
that.&nbsp; No one felt so deeply as she that poetic art is only
at the best the imperfect body in which dwells the poetic
soul.&nbsp; <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>No one felt so deeply as she that as
the notes of the nightingale are but the involuntary expression
of the bird&rsquo;s emotion, and, again, as the perfume of the
violet is but the flower&rsquo;s natural breath, so it is and
must be with the song of the very poet, and that, therefore, to
write beautifully is in a deep and true sense to live
beautifully.&nbsp; In the volume before us, as in all her
previously published writings, we see at its best what
Christianity is as the motive power of poetry.&nbsp; The
Christian idea is essentially feminine, and of this feminine
quality Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s poetry is full.</p>
<p>In motive power the difference between classic and Christian
poetry must needs be very great.&nbsp; But whatever may be said
in favour of one as against the other, this at least cannot be
controverted, that the history of literature shows no human
development so beautiful as the ideal Christian woman of our own
day.&nbsp; She is unique, indeed.&nbsp; Men of science tell us
that among all the fossilized plants we find none of the lovely
family of the rose, and in the same way we should search in vain
through the entire human record for anything so beautiful as that
kind of Christian lady to whom self-abnegation is not only the
first of duties, but the first of joys.&nbsp; Yet, no doubt, the
Christian idea must needs be more or less flavoured by each
personality through which it is expressed.&nbsp; With regard to
Christina <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Rossetti, while upon herself
Christian dogma imposed infinite obligations&mdash;obligations
which could never be evaded by her without the risk of all the
penalties fulminated by all believers&mdash;there was in the
order of things a sort of ether of universal charity for all
others.&nbsp; She would lament, of course, the lapses of every
soul, but for these there was a forgiveness which her own lapses
could never claim.&nbsp; There was, to be sure, a sweet egotism
in this.&nbsp; It was very fascinating, however.&nbsp; This
feeling explains what seems somewhat to puzzle the editor,
especially in the poem called &lsquo;The End of the First
Part,&rsquo; written April 18th, 1849, of which he says,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tears for guilt&rsquo; is in reference to Christina
a very exaggerated phrase&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<h4>THE END OF THE FIRST PART.</h4>
<blockquote><p>My happy dream is finished with,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My dream in which alone I lived so long.<br />
My heart slept&mdash;woe is me, it wakeneth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was weak&mdash;I thought it strong.</p>
<p>Oh, weary wakening from a life-true dream!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh pleasant dream from which I wake in pain!<br />
I rested all my trust on things that seem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my trust is vain.</p>
<p>I must pull down my palace that I built,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig up the pleasure-gardens of my soul;<br />
Must change my laughter to sad tears for guilt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My freedom to control.</p>
<p>Now all the cherished secrets of my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all my hidden hopes, are turned to sin.<br />
Part of my life is dead, part sick, and part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is all on fire within.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>The fruitless thought of what I might have been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haunting me ever, will not let me rest.<br />
A cold North wind has withered all my green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My sun is in the West.</p>
<p>But, where my palace stood, with the same stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will uprear a shady hermitage;<br />
And there my spirit shall keep house alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accomplishing its age.</p>
<p>There other garden beds shall lie around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of sweet-briar and incense-bearing thyme:<br />
There I will sit, and listen for the sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the last lingering chime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the beauty of her life that made her personal influence
so great, and upon no one was that influence exercised with more
strength than upon her illustrious brother Gabriel, who in many
ways was so much unlike her.&nbsp; In spite of his deep religious
instinct and his intense sympathy with mysticism, Gabriel
remained what is called a free thinker in the true meaning of
that much-abused phrase.&nbsp; In religion as in politics he
thought for himself, and yet when Mr. W. M. Rossetti affirms that
the poet was never drawn towards free thinking women, he says
what is perfectly true.&nbsp; And this arose from the
extraordinary influence, scarcely recognized by himself, that the
beauty of Christina&rsquo;s life and her religious system had
upon him.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not the place in which to say much about
him; nor need much at any time and in any place be said, for has
he not <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>written his own
biography&mdash;depicted himself more faithfully than Lockhart
could depict Walter Scott, more faithfully than Boswell could
depict Dr. Johnson?&nbsp; Has he not done this in the immortal
sonnet-sequence called &lsquo;The House of Life&rsquo;?&nbsp;
What poet of the nineteenth century do we know so intimately as
we know the author of &lsquo;The House of Life&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s peculiar form of the Christian
sentiment she inherited from her mother, the sweetness of whose
nature was never disturbed by that exercise of the egoism of the
artist in which Christina indulged and without whose influence it
is difficult to imagine what the Rossetti family would have
been.&nbsp; The father was a poet and a mystic of the
cryptographic kind, and it is by no means unlikely that had he
studied Shakespeare as he studied Dante he would in these days
have been a disciple of the Baconians, and, of course, his
influence on the family in the matter of literary activity and of
mysticism must have been very great.&nbsp; And yet all that is
noblest in Christina&rsquo;s poetry, an ever-present sense of the
beauty and power of goodness, must surely have come from the
mother, from whom also came that other charm of
Christina&rsquo;s, to which Gabriel was peculiarly sensitive, her
youthfulness of temperament.</p>
<p>Among the many differences which exist between the sexes this
might, perhaps, be <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>mentioned, that while it is
beautiful for a man to grow old&mdash;grow old with the passage
of years&mdash;a woman to retain her charm must always remain
young.&nbsp; In a deep sense woman may be said to have but one
paramount charm, youth, and when this is gone all is gone.&nbsp;
The youthfulness of the body, of course, soon vanishes, but with
any woman who can really win and retain the love of man this is
not nearly so important as at first it seems.&nbsp; It is the
youthfulness of the soul that, in the truly adorable woman, is
invulnerable.&nbsp; It is one of the deep misfortunes of the very
poor of cities that as a rule the terrible struggle with the wolf
at the door is apt to sour the nature of women and turn them into
crones at the age when in the more fortunate classes the true
beauty of woman often begins; and even where the environment is
not that of poverty, but of straitened means, it is as a rule
impossible for a woman to retain this youthfulness.</p>
<p>In the case of the Rossettis, in the early period they were in
a position of straitened means.&nbsp; Nor was this all: the
children, Gabriel alone excepted, felt themselves to be by
nationality aliens.&nbsp; Christina, though she made only one
visit to Italy, felt herself to be an Italian, and would smile
when any one talked to her of the John Bullism of her brother
Gabriel, and yet, with these powerful causes working against
their natural elasticity of temperament, both <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>mother and
daughter retained that juvenility which Gabriel Rossetti felt to
be so refreshing.&nbsp; So strong was it in the mother that it
had a strange effect upon the mere physique, and at eighty the
expression in the eyes, and, indeed, on the face throughout,
retained so much of the winsomeness of youth that she was more
beautiful than most young women:&mdash;</p>
<h4>1882.</h4>
<blockquote><p>My blessed mother dozing in her chair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas Day seemed an embodied Love,<br />
A comfortable Love with soft brown hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Softened and silvered to a tint of dove;<br />
A better sort of Venus with an air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Angelical from thoughts that dwell above;<br />
A wiser Pallas in whose body fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enshrined a blessed soul looks out thereof.<br />
Winter brought holly then, now Spring has brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paler and frailer snowdrops shivering;<br />
And I have brought a simple humble thought&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I her devoted duteous Valentine&mdash;<br />
A lifelong thought which thrills this song I sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lifelong love to this dear saint of mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this was not so with Christina, upon whose face
ill-health worked its ravages, her temperament, as we say,
remained as young as ever.&nbsp; The lovely
relations&mdash;sometimes staid and sometimes
playful&mdash;between mother and daughter, are seen throughout
the book before us.&nbsp; But especially are they seen in one
little group of poems&mdash;&ldquo;The Valentines to her
Mother&rdquo;&mdash;in regard to which Christina left the
following pencilled note:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Valentines had their origin from my <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>dearest mother&rsquo;s remarking that she had never
received one.&nbsp; I, her C. G. R., ever after supplied one on
the day; and (so far as I recollect) it was a surprise every
time, she having forgotten all about it in the
interim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rossetti&rsquo;s first valentine was received when she
was nearly seventy-six years of age, and she continued every year
to receive a valentine until 1886, when she died.&nbsp; Surely
there is not in the history of English poetry anything more
fascinating than these valentines.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to see the book open with the following
dedication by Mr. W. M. Rossetti:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Algernon Charles Swinburne, a generous eulogist of
Christina Rossetti, who hailed his genius and prized himself the
greatest of living British poets, my old and constant friend, I
dedicate this book.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>V.&nbsp; DR. GORDON HAKE.<br />
1809&ndash;1895.</h2>
<p>I little thought when I recently quoted from Dr. Hake&rsquo;s
account of that Christmas gathering of the Rossettis at Bognor in
1875&mdash;a gathering which he has made historic&mdash;that
to-day I should be writing an obituary notice of the
&ldquo;parable-poet&rdquo; himself.&nbsp; It is true that, having
fractured a leg in a lamentable accident which befell him, he had
for the last few years been imprisoned in one room and compelled
during most of the time to lie in a horizontal position.&nbsp;
But notwithstanding this, and notwithstanding his great age, his
mental faculties remained so unimpaired that it was hard to
believe his death could be so near.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p208b.jpg">
<img alt="Dr. Gordon Hake.  From a crayon-drawing by D. G.

</a></p>
<p>Although, owing to his intimacy with George Borrow, Hake was
associated in the public mind with the Eastern Counties, he was
not an East Anglian.&nbsp; It was at Leeds (in 1809) that he
first saw the light.&nbsp; His mother was a Gordon of the Huntly
stock, and came of &ldquo;the Park branch&rdquo; of that
house.&nbsp; The famous General Gordon was his first cousin, and
it was owing to this fact that Hake&rsquo;s son, Mr. Egmont <!--
page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Hake, was entrusted with the material for writing his
authoritative books upon the heroic Christian soldier.&nbsp;
Between Hake&rsquo;s eldest son, Mr. T. St. E. Hake, a rising
novelist, and the General the likeness was curiously
strong.&nbsp; Nominated by one of his uncles to Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital, Hake entered that famous school.&nbsp; He gives in his
&lsquo;Memoirs of Eighty Years&rsquo; a very vivid picture of it
and also a really vital portrait of himself.&nbsp; From his very
childhood he was haunted by a literary ambition which can only be
called an insatiable passion.&nbsp; It lasted till the very hour
of his death.&nbsp; When eleven years of age he became acquainted
with that one poet whose immensity of fame has for more than
three centuries been the flame into which the myriad Shakespeare
moths of English literature have been flying.&nbsp; The
Shakespearean of eleven summers did not, like so many Shakespeare
enthusiasts from Davenant down to those latest Shakespeares,
Homers, and Miltons of our contemporary paragraphists, get
himself up to look like the Stratford bust.&nbsp; The only man
who ever really looked like that bust was the late Dion
Boucicault, who did so without trying.&nbsp; But
Shakespeare&rsquo;s wonderful work acted on the imagination of
the child of eleven in an equally humorous way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s perfection,&rdquo; he says in his
memoirs, &ldquo;not only made me envious of the greatest of
writers, but it depressed me in turn with the feeling that <!--
page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>I could never equal it howsoever long I might
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet although this passion never passed away, but waxed with
his years, it must not be supposed that Hake suffered from what
in the &ldquo;new criticism&rdquo; is sweetly and appropriately
called &ldquo;modernity&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, that vulgar
greed for notoriety that in these days, when literature to be
listened to must be puffed like quack medicine and patent soap,
has made the atmosphere of the literary arena somewhat stifling
in the nostrils of those who turn from &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; to
poetic art.&nbsp; Nor was Hake&rsquo;s feeling akin to that fine
despair</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the foreheads of the gods of song</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which true poets, great or small, know&mdash;that fine despair
which, while it will sometimes stop the breath of one of the true
sons of Apollo, as it actually did strike mute Charles Wells, and
as at one time it threatened to stop the breath of Rossetti, will
lead others to write, and write, and write.&nbsp; It is, however,
life&rsquo;s illusions that in most cases make life
tolerable.&nbsp; When in old age calamity came upon Hake, and he
was shut out from life as by a prison wall, his one solace, the
one thing that really bound him to life, was this ambitious dream
which came upon the Bluecoat boy of eleven.</p>
<p>His mother was in easy circumstances, and when a youth Hake
travelled a good deal on the Continent, where his success in the
&ldquo;great <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>world&rdquo; of that time was swift
and complete.&nbsp; If this success was owing as much to his
exceptionally striking personal appearance and natural endowment
of style as to his intellectual equipments&mdash;high as these
were&mdash;that is not surprising to those who knew him.&nbsp; Of
course he was well advanced in years before I was old enough to
call him my friend; but even then he was so extremely handsome a
man that I can well believe the stories I have got from his
family connexions (such as his wife&rsquo;s sisters) of his
appearance in youth.&nbsp; With the single exception of Tennyson,
he was the most poetical-looking poet I have ever seen.&nbsp; And
circumstances put to the best uses his natural gift of style; for
it was in the plastic period of his life that he met the best
people on the Continent and in England.&nbsp; I suspect, indeed,
that after the plastic period in a man&rsquo;s life is passed it
is not of much use for him to come into contact with what used to
be called &ldquo;the great world.&rdquo;&nbsp; To be, or to seem
to be, unconscious of one&rsquo;s own bearing towards the world,
and unconscious of the world&rsquo;s bearing towards oneself, is,
I fancy, impossible to a man&mdash;even though he have the genius
and intellectual endowment of a Browning&mdash;who is for the
first time brought into touch with society after the plastic
period is passed.</p>
<p>I have told elsewhere the whimsical story of Hake and
Rossetti, of Rossetti&rsquo;s delightful <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>account of
his reading as a boy, in a coffee-house in Chancery Lane,
Hake&rsquo;s remarkable romance &lsquo;Vates,&rsquo; afterwards
called &lsquo;Valdarno,&rsquo; in a magazine; his writing a
letter about it to the unknown author, and getting no reply until
many years had passed.&nbsp; Hake&rsquo;s relations towards
Rossetti were of the deepest and most sacred kind.&nbsp; Rossetti
had the highest opinion of Hake&rsquo;s poetical genius, and also
felt towards him the greatest love and gratitude for services of
an inestimable kind rendered to him in the direst crisis of his
life.&nbsp; To enter upon these matters, however, is obviously
impossible in a brief and hurried obituary notice; and equally
impossible is it for me to enter into the poetic principles of a
writer whose very originality has been a barrier to his winning a
wide recognition.</p>
<p>Hake&rsquo;s best work is that, I think, contained in the
volume called &lsquo;New Symbols,&rsquo; in which there is
disclosed an extraordinary variety of poetic power.&nbsp; In
execution, too, he is at his best in that volume.&nbsp; Christina
Rossetti has often told me that &lsquo;Ecce Homo&rsquo; impressed
her more profoundly than did any other poem of her own
time.&nbsp; Also its daring startled her.&nbsp; It was, however,
the previous volume, &lsquo;Madeline, and other Poems,&rsquo;
which brought him into contact with Rossetti&mdash;the great
event of his literary life.</p>
<p>If the man ever lived who could take as much <!-- page
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>interest in another man&rsquo;s work as his own, Dr.
Hake in finding Rossetti found that man.&nbsp; Although at that
time Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, and
Swinburne were running abreast of each other, there was no poet
in England who would not have felt honoured by having his work
reviewed by Rossetti.&nbsp; But Dr. Hake, whose name was
absolutely unknown, had made his way into Rossetti&rsquo;s
affections&mdash;as, indeed, he made his way into the affections
of all who knew him&mdash;and this was quite enough to induce
Rossetti to ask Dr. Appleton for leave to review
&lsquo;Madeline&rsquo; in &rsquo;71 in <i>The Academy</i>&mdash;a
request which Appleton, of course, was delighted to grant.&nbsp;
And again, when in 1873 &lsquo;Parables and Tales&rsquo;
appeared, Mr. John Morley, we may be sure, was something more
than willing to let Rossetti review the book in <i>The
Fortnightly Review</i>; and, again, when &lsquo;New
Symbols&rsquo; appeared, there was some talk about
Rossetti&rsquo;s reviewing it in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>;
but this, for certain reasons which Rossetti explained to
me&mdash;reasons which have been misunderstood, but which were
entirely adequate&mdash;was abandoned.&nbsp; Down to the period
when Dr. Hake went to live in Germany he and his son Mr. Gordon
Hake were among the most intimate friends of the great
poet-painter.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon Hake, indeed, a man of admirable
culture and abilities, lived with Rossetti, who certainly
benefited much by <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>contact with his bright and lively
companion.&nbsp; The portrait of Dr. Hake prefixed to Mrs.
Meynell&rsquo;s selections from his works is one of
Rossetti&rsquo;s finest crayons.&nbsp; It is, however, too heavy
in expression for Hake.</p>
<p>Full of fine qualities as is his best poetry, full of
intellectual subtlety, imagination, and a rare combination of
subjective with objective power, there is apparently in it a
certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> which has prevented him at present
from winning his true meed of fame.&nbsp; His hand, no doubt, is
uncertain; but so is the hand of many a successful
poet&mdash;that of Christina Rossetti, for instance.&nbsp; For
sheer originality of conception and of treatment what recent
poems surpass or even equal &lsquo;Old Souls&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Serpent Charmer&rsquo;?&nbsp; Then take the remarkable
mastery over colour exhibited by &lsquo;Ortrud&rsquo;s
Vision.&rsquo;&nbsp; His volume of pantheistic sonnets in the
Shakespearean form, &lsquo;The New Day,&rsquo; written in his
eighty-first year, is on the whole, however, his most remarkable
work.&nbsp; The kind of Sufeyistic nature ecstasy displayed
therein by a man of so advanced an age is nothing less than
wonderful.&nbsp; And as to knowledge of nature, not even
Wordsworth or Tennyson knew nature so completely as did Hake, for
he had a thorough training as a naturalist.&nbsp; In looking at a
flower he could enjoy not only its beauty, but also the delight
of picturing to himself the flower&rsquo;s inherited <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>beauty and the ancestors from which the flower got its
inheritance.&nbsp; And as regards the lyrical flow imported into
so monumental a form as the sonnet, every student of this form
must needs study the book with the greatest interest.&nbsp; His
very latest work, however, is in prose.&nbsp; I find it extremely
difficult to write about &lsquo;Memoirs of Eighty
Years.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is full of remarkable qualities: wit,
humour, an ebullience of animal spirits that is
Rabelaisian.&nbsp; What it lacks (and in some portions of it
greatly lacks) is delicacy, refinement of tone.&nbsp; And surely
this is remarkable when we realize the kind of man he was who
wrote it.</p>
<p>It has been my privilege to go about with him not only in
London, but also in Rome, in Paris, in Venice, in Florence, Pisa,
&amp;c.; and no matter what might be the quality of the society
with which he was brought into contact, it always seemed to me
that he was distinguished by his very lack of that accentuated
movement which the <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i> generally
displays.&nbsp; I merely dwell upon this to show how inscrutable
are the mental processes in the crowning puzzle of the great
humourist Nature, the writing man.&nbsp; Just as the most angular
and <i>gauche</i> man in a literary gathering may possibly turn
out to be the poet whose lyrics have been compared to Shelley, or
the prose writer whose mellifluous periods have been compared to
those of Plato, so the most dignified man in <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the room
may turn out to be the writer of a book whose defect is a
noticeable lack of dignified style.&nbsp; It was hard, indeed,
for those who knew Hake in the flesh to believe that the
&lsquo;Memoirs of Eighty Years&rsquo; was written by him.&nbsp; I
suppose I shall be expected to say a word about the famous
intimacy between Hake and Borrow.&nbsp; After Hake went to live
in Germany, Borrow told me a good deal about this intimacy and
also about his own early life; for reticent as he naturally was,
he and I got to be confidential and intimate.&nbsp; His
friendship with Hake began when Hake was practising as a
physician in Norfolk.&nbsp; It lasted during the greater part of
Borrow&rsquo;s later life.&nbsp; When Borrow was living in
London, his great delight was to walk over on Sundays from
Hereford Square to Coombe End, call upon Hake, and take a stroll
with him over Richmond Park.&nbsp; They both had a passion for
herons and for deer.&nbsp; At that time Hake was a very intimate
friend of my own, and having had the good fortune to be
introduced by him to Borrow, I used to join the two in their
walks.&nbsp; Afterwards, when Hake went to live in Germany, I
used to take these walks with Borrow alone.&nbsp; Two more
interesting men it would be impossible to meet.&nbsp; The
remarkable thing was that there was between them no sort of
intellectual sympathy.&nbsp; In style, in education, in
experience, whatever Hake was Borrow was <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>not.&nbsp;
Borrow knew almost nothing of Hake&rsquo;s writings, either in
prose or in verse.&nbsp; His ideal poet was Pope, and when he
read, or rather looked into, Hake&rsquo;s &lsquo;World&rsquo;s
Epitaph,&rsquo; he thought he did Hake the greatest honour by
saying, &ldquo;There are lines here and there that are nigh as
good as Pope&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand,
Hake&rsquo;s acquaintance with Borrow&rsquo;s works was far
behind that of some Borrovians who did not know Lavengro in the
flesh, such as Mr. Saintsbury and Mr. Birrell.</p>
<p>Borrow was shy, eccentric, angular, rustic in accent and in
locution, but with a charm for me, at least, that was
irresistible.&nbsp; Hake was polished, easy, and urbane in
everything, and, although not without prejudice and bias, ready
to shine gracefully in any society.&nbsp; As far as Hake was
concerned, the sole link between them was that of reminiscence of
earlier days and adventures in Borrow&rsquo;s beloved East
Anglia.&nbsp; Among many proofs that I could adduce of this, I
will give one.&nbsp; I am the possessor of the manuscript of
Borrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gypsies in Spain,&rsquo; written partly in
a Spanish note-book as he moved about Spain in his colporteur
days.&nbsp; It was my wish that Hake would leave behind him some
memorial of Borrow more worthy of himself and his friend than
those brief reminiscences contained in &lsquo;Memoirs of Eighty
Years.&rsquo;&nbsp; I took to Hake this precious relic of one of
the most wonderful men of the nineteenth <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>century in
order to discuss with him differences between the MS. and the
printed text.&nbsp; Hake was sitting in his invalid chair,
writing verses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does it all matter?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think you understand Lavengro,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; Hake replied, &ldquo;And yet Lavengro had an
advantage over me, for <i>he</i> understood <i>nobody</i>.&nbsp;
Every individuality with which he was brought into contact had,
as no one knows better than you, to be tinged with colours of his
own before he could see it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, of course, was true enough; and Hake&rsquo;s asperities
when speaking of Borrow in &lsquo;Memoirs of Eighty
Years&rsquo;&mdash;asperities which have vexed a good many
Borrovians&mdash;simply arose from the fact that it was
impossible for two such men to understand each other.&nbsp; When
I told him of Andrew Lang&rsquo;s angry onslaught upon Borrow, in
his notes to the &ldquo;Waverley Novels,&rdquo; on account of his
attacks upon Scott, he said, &ldquo;Well, and does he not deserve
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I told him of Miss Cobbe&rsquo;s
description of Borrow as a <i>poseur</i>, he said to me, &ldquo;I
told you the same scores of times.&nbsp; But I saw that Borrow
had bewitched you during that first walk under the rainbow in
Richmond Park.&nbsp; It was that rainbow, I think, that befooled
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s affection for Hake, however, was
both strong and deep, as I saw after Hake had gone to Germany and
in a way dropped out of Borrow&rsquo;s ken.&nbsp; Yet Hake was as
good a man <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>as ever Borrow was, and for certain
others with whom he was brought in contact as full of a genuine
affection as Borrow was himself.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 219</span>JOHN LEICESTER WARREN, LORD DE
TABLEY.<br />
1835&ndash;1895.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>In the death of Lord de Tabley, the English world of letters
has lost a true poet and a scholar of very varied
accomplishments.&nbsp; His friends have lost much more.&nbsp;
Since his last attack of influenza, those who knew him and loved
him had been much concerned about him.&nbsp; The pallor of his
complexion had greatly increased; so had his feebleness.&nbsp; As
long ago as May last, when I called upon him at the
Athen&aelig;um Club in order to join him at a luncheon he was
giving at the Caf&eacute; Royal, I found that he had engaged a
four-wheeled cab to take us over those few yards.&nbsp; The
expression in his kind and wistful blue-grey eyes showed that he
had noted the start of surprise I gave on seeing the cab waiting
for us.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know my love of a growler,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;this is just to save us the bother of getting across
the Piccadilly cataracts.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought to myself,
&ldquo;I wish it were only the bother of crossing the cataracts
which accounts for the growler.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Another sign that the physical part of him was in the
grip of the demon of decay was that, instead of coming to the
Pines to luncheon, as had been his wont, he preferred of late to
come to afternoon tea, and return to Elm Park before
dinner.&nbsp; And on the occasion when he last came in this way
it seemed to us here that he had aged still more; yet his
intellectual forces had lost nothing of their power.&nbsp; And as
a companion he was as winsome as ever.&nbsp; That fine quality
with which he was so richly endowed, the quality which used to be
called &ldquo;urbanity,&rdquo; was as fresh when I saw him last
as when I first knew him.&nbsp; That sweet sagacity, mellowed and
softened by a peculiarly quiet humour, shone from his face at
intervals as he talked of the pleasant old days when he was my
colleague on <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, and when I used to call
upon him so frequently on my way to Rossetti in Cheyne Walk to
chat over &ldquo;the walnuts and the wine&rdquo; about
poetry.</p>
<p>My own friendship with him began at my first meeting him, and
this was long ago.&nbsp; Being at that time a less-known man of
letters than I am now, supposing that to be possible, I was
astonished one day when my friend Edmund Gosse told me that his
friend Leicester Warren had expressed a wish to meet me on
account of certain things of mine which he had read in <i>The
Examiner</i> and <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; I accepted with
alacrity Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s invitation to one of those <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>charming <i>salons</i> of his on the banks of
Westbournia&rsquo;s Grand Canal which have become historic.&nbsp;
I was surprised to find Warren, who was then scarcely above
forty, looking so old, not to say so old-fashioned.&nbsp; At that
time he did not wear the moustache and beard which afterwards
lent a picturesqueness to his face.&nbsp; There was a kind of
rural appearance about him which had for me a charm of its own;
it suited so well with his gentle ways, I thought.&nbsp; This
being the impression he made upon me, it may be imagined how
delighted I was shortly afterwards to see him come to the door of
Ivy Lodge, Putney, where I was then living alone.&nbsp; Nor was I
less surprised than delighted to see him.&nbsp; On realizing at
Gosse&rsquo;s <i>salon</i> that my new acquaintance was a
botanist, I had fraternized with him on this point, and had
described to him an extremely rare and lovely little tree growing
in the centre of my garden, which some unknown lover of trees had
imported.&nbsp; I had given Warren a kind of general invitation
to come some day and see it.&nbsp; So early a call as this I had
not hoped to get.&nbsp; Perhaps I thought so reclusive a man as
he even then appeared would never come at all.</p>
<p>After having duly admired the tree he turned to the Rossetti
crayons on the walls of the rooms; but although he talked much
about &lsquo;The Spirit of the Rainbow&rsquo; and the design from
the same beautiful model which William <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Sharp has
christened &lsquo;Forced Music,&rsquo; the loveliness of which
attracted him not a little, I perceived that he had something
else that he wanted to talk about, and allowed him to lead the
conversation up to it.&nbsp; To my surprise I found that, so far
from having perceived how much he had interested me, he had
imagined that my attitude towards him was constrained, and had
explained it to his own discomfort after the following fashion:
&ldquo;Watts has an intimate friend of whose poetry I am a deep
admirer&mdash;so deep indeed that some people, and not without
reason, have said that my own poetry is unduly influenced by
it.&nbsp; But an article by me in <i>The Fortnightly</i> goes out
of its way to dub as a &lsquo;minor poet&rsquo; the very writer
to whose influence I have succumbed.&nbsp; It is the incongruity
between my dubbing my idol a &lsquo;minor poet&rsquo; and my real
and most obvious admiration of his work that makes Watts, in
spite of an external civility, feel unfriendly towards me.&nbsp;
Yet there is no real incongruity, for it was the editor, G. H.
Lewes, who, after my proof had been returned for press,
interpolated the objectionable words about the minor
poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was how he had been reasoning.&nbsp; When I laughed and
told him to recast his syllogism&mdash;told him that I had never
seen the article in question, and doubted whether my friend
had&mdash;matters became very bright between us.&nbsp; He stayed
to luncheon; we walked <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>on the
Common; I showed him our Wimbledon sun-dews; in a word, I felt
that I had discovered a richer gold mine than the richest in the
world, a new friend.&nbsp; Had I then known him as well as I
afterwards did, I should have been aware that he had a strong
dash of the sensitive, not to say the morbid, in his
nature.&nbsp; He had a habit of submitting almost every incident
of his life to such an analysis as that I have been
describing.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when years later he had a difference with
a friend, I reminded him of the incident recorded above, and made
him laugh by saying, &ldquo;My dear Warren, you are so afraid of
treading on people&rsquo;s corns that you tread upon
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On first visiting him, as on many a subsequent occasion, I was
struck by the variety of his intellectual interests, and the
thoroughness with which he pursued them all.&nbsp; I have lately
said in print what I fully believe&mdash;that he was the most
learned of English poets, if learning means something more than
mere scholarship.&nbsp; He was a skilled numismatist, and in 1862
published, through the Numismatic Society, &lsquo;An Essay on
Greek Federal Coinage,&rsquo; and an essay &lsquo;On Some Coins
of Lycia under Rhodian Domination and of the Lycian
League.&rsquo;&nbsp; He even took an interest in book-plates, and
actually, in 1880, published &lsquo;A Guide to the Study of
Book-Plates.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should not have been <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>at
all surprised to learn that he was also writing a guide for the
collectors of postage stamps.</p>
<p>At this time he had published a good deal of verse; for
instance, &lsquo;Eclogues and Monodramas&rsquo; in 1865;
&lsquo;Studies in Verse&rsquo; in 1866; &lsquo;Orestes&rsquo; in
1867; a collection of poems called &lsquo;Rehearsals&rsquo; in
1873; another collection, called &lsquo;The Searching Net,&rsquo;
in 1876.&nbsp; From this time, during many years, I saw him
frequently, although, for a reason which it is not necessary to
discuss here, he became seized with a deep dislike of the
literary world and its doings, and I am not aware that he saw any
literary man save myself and the late W. B. Scott, the bond
between whom and himself was &ldquo;book-plates&rdquo;!&nbsp;
Then he took to residing in the country.&nbsp; As a poet he
seemed to be quite forgotten, save by students of poetry, until
his name was revived by means of Mr. Miles&rsquo;s colossal
anthology &lsquo;The Poets and the Poetry of the Nineteenth
Century,&rsquo; Mr. Miles, it seems, was a great admirer of Lord
de Tabley&rsquo;s poetry, and managed to reach the hermit in his
cell.&nbsp; In the sixth volume of his work Mr. Miles gave a
judicious selection from Lord de Tabley&rsquo;s poems and an
admirable essay upon them.&nbsp; The selection attracted a good
deal of attention.</p>
<p>On finding that the public would listen to him, I urged him to
bring out a volume of selected pieces from all his works, an idea
which for some time he contested with his usual <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>pessimistic vigour.&nbsp; Having, however, set my heart
upon it, I spoke upon the subject to Mr. John Lane, who at once
saw his way to bring out such a volume at his own risk.&nbsp; To
the poet&rsquo;s astonishment the book was a success, and it at
once passed into a second edition.&nbsp; In the spring of this
year he was emboldened to bring out another volume of new poems,
and his name became firmly re-established as a poet.&nbsp; It was
after the success of the first book that he consulted me upon a
question which was then upon his mind: Should he devote his
future energies to literature or to making himself a position as
a speaker in the Lords?&nbsp; He had lately had occasion to speak
both in the country and in the Lords upon some local matter of
importance, and his success had in some slight degree revived an
old aspiration to plunge into the world of politics.&nbsp; He was
a Liberal, and in 1868 he had contested&mdash;but
unsuccessfully&mdash;Mid-Cheshire.&nbsp; This was on the first
election for that division after the Reform Act of 1867.&nbsp;
His support in a county so Conservative as Cheshire had really
been very strong, but he never made another effort to get into
Parliament.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know my way,&rdquo; he used to
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can make one spring&mdash;perhaps a pretty
good spring&mdash;but not more than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, he leaned towards the idea of going into
politics.&nbsp; The way in which he put the case to me was
thoroughly characteristic of <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>him:
&ldquo;Even if my verse were strong and vital, which I fear it is
not, there is almost no chance for men of my generation receiving
more than a slight attention at the present day.&nbsp; Things
have altogether changed since the sixties and seventies, when I
published my most important work&mdash;at a time when the
prominent names were Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold,
Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne.&nbsp; The old critical oracles
are now dumb; the reviewers are all young men whose knowledge of
poetry does not go back so far as the sixties.&nbsp; Those who
reviewed the selection from my work in Miles&rsquo;s book showed
themselves to be entirely unconscious of the name of Leicester
Warren, and treated the poems there selected as being the work of
a new writer; and even when the poems published by Lane came out,
no one seemed to be aware that they were by a writer who was very
much to the fore a quarter of a century ago.&nbsp; That book has
had a flutter of success, but in how large a degree was the
success owing to the curiosity excited by the book of a man of my
generation being brought out now, and by the publisher of the men
of this?&nbsp; With all my sympathy with the work of the younger
men and my admiration of some of it, things, I say, have changed
since those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not share these pessimistic views.&nbsp; Moreover,
knowing as I did how extremely <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>sensitive
he was, I knew that his figuring in Parliament would result in
the greatest pain to him, and if I gave a somewhat exaggerated
expression with regard to my hopes of him in the literary world,
it was a kindly feeling towards himself that impelled me to do
so.&nbsp; He took my advice and proceeded to gather material for
another volume.</p>
<p>To define clearly the impression left upon one by intercourse
with any man is difficult.&nbsp; In De Tabley&rsquo;s case it is
almost impossible.&nbsp; His remarkable modesty, or rather
diffidence, was what, perhaps, struck me most.&nbsp; It was a
genuine lack of faith in his own powers; it had nothing whatever
to do with &ldquo;mock-modesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had a singular
instance of this diffidence in the autumn of last year.&nbsp;
Lord de Tabley, who was staying at Ryde, having learnt that I was
staying with a friend near Niton Bay, wrote to me there saying
that he somewhat specially wanted to see me, and proposed our
lunching together at an hotel at Ventnor.&nbsp; I was delighted
to accede to this, for, like all who fully knew Lord de Tabley, I
was thoroughly and deeply attached to him.&nbsp; He was so
genuine and so modest and so genial&mdash;unsoured by the great
and various sorrows of which he used sometimes to talk to me by
the cosy study fire&mdash;nay, sweetened by them, as I often
thought&mdash;so grateful for the smallest service rendered in an
arena where ingratitude sometimes seems <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>to be the
<i>vis motrix</i> of life&mdash;a truly lovable man, if ever
there was one.</p>
<p>I drove over to Ventnor.&nbsp; As I chanced to reach the hotel
somewhat before the appointed time, and he had not arrived, I
drove on to Bonchurch along the Shanklin road.&nbsp; On my way
back, I passed a four-wheel cab; but not dreaming that his love
of the &ldquo;growler&rdquo; reached beyond London, I never
thought of him in connexion with it until I saw the well-known
face with its sweet thoughtful expression looking through the cab
window.&nbsp; On this occasion it looked so specially thoughtful
that I imagined something serious had occurred.&nbsp; At the
hotel I found that he had secured a snug room and a luxurious
luncheon.&nbsp; An ominous packet of writing-paper peering from
his overcoat pocket convinced me that it was a manuscript brought
for me to read, and feeling that I should prefer to get it over
before luncheon, I asked him to show it to me.&nbsp; He then told
me its history.&nbsp; Having sent by special invitation a poem to
<i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, the editor had returned
it&mdash;returned it with certain strictures upon portions of
it.&nbsp; This incident he had at once subjected to the usual
analysis, and had come to the conclusion that certain outside
influences of an invidious kind had been brought to play upon the
editor.</p>
<p>Time was when I should have shrunk with terror from so
thankless a task as that of reading <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>a
manuscript with such a frightful history, but it is astonishing
what a long experience in the literary world will do for a man in
perplexities of this kind.&nbsp; I read the manuscript and the
editor&rsquo;s courteous but sagacious comments, and I found that
the poet had undertaken a subject which was utterly and almost
inconceivably alien to his genius.&nbsp; As I read I felt the
wistful gaze fixed upon me while the waiter was moving in and out
of the room, preparing the luncheon table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, as I laid the manuscript down,
&ldquo;what do you think? do you agree with the
editor?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not entirely!&rdquo; he exclaimed; then turning to the
waiter, he said, &ldquo;You can leave the soup, and I will ring
when we are ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; I
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all the editor&rsquo;s strictures I
entirely agree, but he says that by working upon it you may make
it into a worthy poem: there I disagree with him.&nbsp; I
consider it absolutely hopeless.&nbsp; I regret now that we did
not leave the matter until after luncheon, but we will not let it
spoil our appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid it did spoil our appetites nevertheless, for I
felt that I had been compelled, for his own sake, to give him
pain.&nbsp; He was much depressed, declared that the success of
his late book was entirely factitious, and vowed that nothing
should ever persuade him to write another line of verse, and that
he would now devote his attention to a peer&rsquo;s duties in the
<!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>House of Lords.&nbsp; I was so disturbed myself at thus
paining so lovable a friend that next day I wrote to him, trying
to soften what I had said, and urged him to do as the editor of
<i>The Nineteenth Century</i> had suggested, write another
poem&mdash;a poem upon some classical subject, which he would
deal with so admirably.&nbsp; The result of it all was that he
found the editor&rsquo;s strictures on the unlucky poem to be
absolutely well grounded, and wrote for <i>The Nineteenth
Century</i> &lsquo;Orpheus,&rsquo; one of the finest of his later
poems.</p>
<p>I think these anecdotes of Lord de Tabley will show why we who
knew him were so attached to him.</p>
<h3><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>II.</h3>
<p>Can it be claimed for Lord de Tabley that in the poetical
firmament which hung over the days of his youth&mdash;when the
heavens were bright with such luminaries as Tennyson, Browning,
Matthew Arnold, Rossetti, Swinburne, and Morris&mdash;he had a
place of his own?&nbsp; We think it can.&nbsp; And in saying this
we are fully conscious of the kind of praise we are awarding
him.&nbsp; Whatever may be said for or against the artistic
temper of the present hour, it must certainly be said of the time
we are alluding to that it was great as regards its wealth of
poetic genius, and as regards its artistic temper greater
still.&nbsp; It was a time when &ldquo;the beauteous damsel
Poesy, honourable and retired,&rdquo; whom Cervantes described,
dared still roam the English Parnassus, &ldquo;a friend of
solitude,&rdquo; disturbed by no clash of Notoriety&rsquo;s
brazen cymbals, &ldquo;where fountains entertained her, woods
freed her from <i>ennui</i>, and flowers delighted
her&rdquo;&mdash;delighted her for their own sakes.&nbsp; In
order to write such verses as the following from the concluding
poem of the volume before us <a name="citation231"></a><a
href="#footnote231" class="citation">[231]</a> a man must really
have passed <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>into that true mood of the poet
described by the great Spanish humourist:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>How idle for a spurious fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To roll in thorn-beds of unrest;<br />
What matter whom the mob acclaim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou art master of thy breast?</p>
<p>If sick thy soul with fear and doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weary with the rabble din,&mdash;<br />
If thou wouldst scorn the herd without,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First make the discord calm within.</p>
<p>If we are lords in our disdain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rule our kingdoms of despair,<br />
As fools we shall not plough the main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For halters made of syren&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>We need not traverse foreign earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek an alien Sorrow&rsquo;s face.<br />
She sits within thy central hearth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at thy table has her place.</p>
<p>So with this hour of push and pelf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where nought unsordid seems to last,<br />
Vex not thy miserable self,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But search the fallows of the past.</p>
<p>In Time&rsquo;s rich track behind us lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A soil replete with root and seed;<br />
There harvest wheat repays the wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While idiots find but charlock weed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the writer of the above lines and those great poets
who in his youth were his contemporaries there is this point of
affinity: like them his actual achievements do not strike the
reader so forcibly as the potentialities which those achievements
reveal.&nbsp; In the same way that Achilles was suggested by his
&ldquo;spear&rdquo; in the picture in the chamber of Lucrece, the
poet who writes not for fame, but writes to <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>please
himself, suggests unconsciously his own portrait by every
touch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For much imaginary work was there;<br />
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,<br />
That for Achilles&rsquo; image stood his spear<br />
Grip&rsquo;d in an arm&egrave;d hand; himself behind<br />
Was left unseen save to the eye of mind:<br />
A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,<br />
Stood for the whole to be imagin&egrave;d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poets, indeed, have always been divisible into those whose
poetry gives the reader an impression that they are greater than
their work, and those whose poetry gives the reader a contrary
impression.&nbsp; There have always been poets who may say of
themselves, like the &ldquo;Poet&rdquo; in &lsquo;Timon of
Athens,&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes<br />
From whence &rsquo;tis nourished: the fire i&rsquo; the flint<br
/>
Shows not till it be struck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there have always been poets whose verse, howsoever good
it may be, shows that, although they have been able to mould into
poetic forms the riches of the life around them, and also of the
literature which has come to them as an inheritance, they are
simply working for fame, or rather for notoriety, in the markets
of the outer world.&nbsp; The former can give us an impression of
personal greatness such as the latter cannot.</p>
<p>With regard to the originality of Lord de Tabley&rsquo;s work,
it is obvious that every poet must in some measure be influenced
by the <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>leading luminaries of his own
period.&nbsp; But at no time would it have been fair to call Lord
de Tabley an imitator; and in the new poems in this volume the
accent is, perhaps, more individual than was the accent of any of
his previous poetry.&nbsp; The general reader&rsquo;s
comparatively slight acquaintance with Greek poetry may become
unfortunate for modern poets.&nbsp; Often and often it occurs
that a poet is charged with imitating another poet of a more
prominent position than his own when, as a matter of fact, both
poets have been yielding to the magic influence of some poet of
Greece.&nbsp; Such a yielding has been held to be legitimate in
every literature of the modern world.&nbsp; Indeed, to be
coloured by the great classics of Greek and Roman literature is
the inevitable destiny and the special glory of all the best
poetry of the modern world, as it is the inevitable destiny and
the special glory of the far-off waters of the Nile to be
enriched and toned by the far-off wealth of Ruwenzori and the
great fertilizing lakes from which they have sprung.&nbsp; But in
drawing from the eternal fountains of beauty Lord de
Tabley&rsquo;s processes were not those of his great
contemporaries; they were very specially his own, as far removed
from the severe method of Matthew Arnold on the one hand as from
Tennyson&rsquo;s method on the other.</p>
<p>His way of work was always to illustrate a story of Hellenic
myth by symbols and <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>analogies drawn not from the more
complex economies of a later world, as was Tennyson&rsquo;s way,
but from that wide knowledge of the phenomena of nature which can
be attained only by a poet whose knowledge is that of the
naturalist.&nbsp; His devotion to certain departments of natural
science has been running parallel with his devotion to poetry,
and if learning is something wider than scholarship, he is the
most learned poet of his time.&nbsp; While Tennyson&rsquo;s
knowledge of natural science, though wide, was gathered from
books, Lord de Tabley&rsquo;s knowledge, especially in the
department of botany, is derived largely from original
observation and inquiry.&nbsp; And this knowledge enables him to
make his poetry alive with organic detail such as satisfies the
naturalist as fully as the other qualities in his works satisfy
the lover of poetry.&nbsp; The leading poem of the present
volume, &lsquo;Orpheus in Hades,&rsquo; is full of a knowledge of
the ways of nature beyond the reach of most poets, and yet this
knowledge is kept well in governance by his artistic sense; it is
never obtruded&mdash;never more than hinted at,
indeed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Soon, soon I saw the spectral vanguard come,<br />
Coasting along, as swallows, beating low<br />
Before a hint of rain.&nbsp; In buoyant air,<br />
Circling thy poise, and hardly move the wing,<br />
And rather float than fly.&nbsp; Then other spirits,<br />
Shrill and more fierce, came wailing down the gale;<br />
As plaintive plovers came with swoop and scream<br />
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

So these, as lapwing guardians, sailed and swung<br />
To save the secrets of their gloomy lair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I hate to watch the flower set up its face.<br />
I loathe the trembling shimmer of the sea,<br />
Its heaving roods of intertangled weed<br />
And orange sea-wrack with its necklace fruit;<br />
The stale, insipid cadence of the dawn,<br />
The ringdove, tedious harper on five tones,<br />
The eternal havoc of the sodden leaves,<br />
Rotting the floors of Autumn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The Death of Pha&euml;thon&rsquo; is another poem in
which Lord de Tabley succeeds in mingling a true poetic energy
with that subtle dignity of utterance which can never really be
divorced from true poetry, whether the poet&rsquo;s subject be
lofty or homely.</p>
<p>The line</p>
<blockquote><p>With sudden ray and music across the sea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the opening line of the poem,</p>
<blockquote><p>Before him the immeasurable heaven,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cause us to think that Lord de Tabley has paid but little
attention to the question of elision in English poetry.&nbsp; In
the second of the lines above quoted elision is impossible, in
the first elision is demanded.&nbsp; The reason why elision is
sometimes demanded is that in certain lines, as in the one which
opens &lsquo;Orpheus in Hades,&rsquo; the hiatus which occurs
when a word ending with a vowel is followed by a vowel beginning
the next word may be so great as to <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>become
intolerable.&nbsp; The reason why elision is sometimes a merely
allowable beauty is that when a word ends with <i>w</i>,
<i>r</i>, or <i>l</i>, to elide the liquids is to secure a kind
of billowy music of a peculiarly delightful kind.&nbsp; Now
elision is very specially demanded in a line like that which
opens &lsquo;Orpheus in Hades,&rsquo; where the pause of the line
fall upon <i>the</i>.&nbsp; To make the main pause of the line
fall upon <i>the</i> is extremely and painfully bad, even when
the next word begins with a consonant; but when the word
following <i>the</i> begins with a vowel, the line is absolutely
immetrical; it has, indeed, no more to do with English prosody
than with that prosody of Japan upon which Mr. Basil Chamberlain
discourses so pleasantly.&nbsp; On the other hand, the elision of
the second syllable of the word <i>music</i> in the other line
quoted above is equally faulty in another direction.&nbsp; But as
we said when reviewing Mr. Bridges&rsquo;s treatise on
Milton&rsquo;s prosody, nothing is more striking than the
helplessness of most recent poets when confronted with the simple
question of elision.</p>
<p>In an &lsquo;Ode to a Star&rsquo; there is great beauty and
breadth of thought and expression.&nbsp; Its only structural
blemish, that of an opening stanza whose form is not distinctly
followed, can be so easily put right that it need only be
mentioned here in order to emphasize the canon that it is only in
irregular odes that variation of stanza is permissible.&nbsp;
Keats, no doubt, in <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>one at least of his unequalled odes,
does depart from the scheme of structure indicated by the opening
stanza, and without any apparent metrical need for so
doing.&nbsp; But the poem does not gain by the departure.&nbsp;
Besides, Keats is now a classic, and has a freedom in regard to
irregularities of metre which Lord de Tabley would be the last to
claim for himself.&nbsp; Another blemish of a minor kind in the
&lsquo;Ode to a Star&rsquo; is that of rhyming
&ldquo;meteor&rdquo; with &ldquo;wheatear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the poetry in Lord de Tabley&rsquo;s volume answers as
little to Milton&rsquo;s famous list of the poetic requirements,
&ldquo;simple, sensuous, and passionate,&rdquo; as does
Milton&rsquo;s own poetry, which answers to only the second of
these demands, very high poetry might be cited which is neither
sensuous nor passionate.&nbsp; The so-called coldness displayed
by &lsquo;Lycidas&rsquo; arises not, it may well be supposed,
from any lack on Milton&rsquo;s part of sorrow for his friend,
but from his determination that simple he would not be, and yet
his method is justified of its own beauty and glory.&nbsp; Of
course poetry may be too ornate, but in demanding a simplicity of
utterance from the poet it is easy for the critic to forget how
wide and how various are poetry&rsquo;s domains.&nbsp; For if in
one mood poetry is the simple and unadorned expression of nature,
in another it is the woof of art,</p>
<blockquote><p>Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes<br />
As are the tiger-moth&rsquo;s deep-damasked wings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>In the matter of poetic ornament, all that the reader
has any right to demand is that the decoration should be poetical
and not rhetorical.&nbsp; Now, as a matter of fact, there is no
surer sign of the amount of the poetical endowment of any poet
than the insight he shows into the nature of poetry as
distinguished from rhetoric when working on ornate poetry.&nbsp;
It is a serious impeachment of latter-day criticism that in very
many cases, perhaps in most cases, the plaudits given to the last
new &ldquo;leading poet&rdquo; of the hour are awarded to
&ldquo;felicitous lines,&rdquo; every felicity of which is
rhetorical and not poetical.</p>
<h2><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>VII.&nbsp; WILLIAM MORRIS.<br />
1834&ndash;1896.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>The news of the grave turn suddenly taken by William
Morris&rsquo;s illness prepared the public for the still worse
news that was to follow.</p>
<p>The certificate of the immediate cause of death affirms it to
have been phthisis, but one would suppose that almost every vital
organ had become exhausted.&nbsp; Each time that I saw him he
declared, in answer to my inquiries, that he suffered no pain
whatever.&nbsp; And a comforting thought this is to us
all&mdash;that Morris suffered no pain.&nbsp; To Death himself we
may easily be reconciled&mdash;nay, we might even look upon him
as Nature&rsquo;s final beneficence to all her children, if it
were not for the cruel means he so often employs in fulfilling
his inevitable mission.&nbsp; The thought that Morris&rsquo;s
life had ended in the tragedy of pain&mdash;the thought that he
to whom work was sport and generosity the highest form of
enjoyment, suffered what some men suffer in shuffling off <!--
page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>the mortal coil&mdash;would have been intolerable
almost.&nbsp; For among the thousand and one charms of the man,
this, perhaps, was the chief, that Nature had endowed him with an
enormous capacity of enjoyment, and that Circumstance, conspiring
with Nature, said to him, &ldquo;Enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p240b.jpg">
<img alt="William Morris" src="images/p240s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Born in easy circumstances, though not to the degrading
trouble of wealth&mdash;cherishing as his sweetest possessions a
devoted wife and two daughters, each of them endowed with
intelligence so rare as to understand a genius such as
his&mdash;surrounded by friends, some of whom were among the
first men of our time, and most of whom were of the very salt of
the earth&mdash;it may be said of him that Misfortune, if she
touched him at all, never struck home.&nbsp; If it is true, as
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e affirms, that men are hastened to maturity
by misfortune, who wanted Morris to be mature?&nbsp; Who wanted
him to be other than the radiant boy of genius that he remained
till the years had silvered his hair and carved wrinkles on his
brow, but left his blue-grey eyes as bright as when they first
opened on the world?&nbsp; Enough for us to think that the man
must, indeed, be specially beloved by the gods who in his
sixty-third year dies young.&nbsp; Old age Morris could not have
borne with patience.&nbsp; Pain would not have developed him into
a hero.&nbsp; This beloved man, who must have died some day, died
when his marvellous powers were at their best&mdash;and died <!--
page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>without pain.&nbsp; The scheme of life and death does
not seem so much awry, after all.</p>
<p>At the last interview but one that ever I had with
him&mdash;it was in the little carpetless room from which so much
of his best work was turned out&mdash;he himself surprised me by
leading the conversation upon a subject he rarely chose to talk
about&mdash;the mystery of life and death.&nbsp; The conversation
ended with these words of his: &ldquo;I have enjoyed my
life&mdash;few men more so&mdash;and death in any case is
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult not to think that the cause of causes of his
death was excessive exercise of all his forces, especially of the
imaginative faculty.&nbsp; When I talked to him, as I often did,
of the peril of such a life of tension as his, he pooh-poohed the
idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at Gladstone,&rdquo; he would say;
&ldquo;look at those wise owls your chancellors and your
judges.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t they live all the longer for
work?&nbsp; It is rust that kills men, not work.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
doubt he was right in contending that in intellectual efforts
such as those he alluded to, where the only faculty drawn upon is
the &ldquo;dry light of intelligence,&rdquo; a prodigious amount
of work may be achieved without any sapping of the sources of
life.&nbsp; But is this so where that fusion of all the faculties
which we call genius is greatly taxed?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; In
all true imaginative production there is, as De Quincey pointed
out many years ago, a movement not of &ldquo;the thinking
machine&rdquo; only, but of the <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>whole
man&mdash;the whole &ldquo;genial&rdquo; nature of the
worker&mdash;his imagination, his judgment, moving in an
evolution of lightning velocity from the whole of the work to the
part, from the part to the whole, together with every emotion of
the soul.&nbsp; Hence when, as in the case of Walter Scott, of
Charles Dickens, and presumably of Shakespeare too, the emotional
nature of Man is overtaxed, every part of the frame suffers, and
cries out in vain for its share of that nervous fluid which is
the true <i>vis vit&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>We have only to consider the sort of work Morris produced and
its amount to realize that no human powers could continue to
withstand such a strain.&nbsp; Many are of opinion that
&lsquo;The Lovers of Gudrun&rsquo; is his finest poem; he worked
at it from four o&rsquo;clock in the morning till four in the
afternoon, and when he rose from the table he had produced 750
lines!&nbsp; Think of the forces at work in producing a poem like
&lsquo;Sigurd.&rsquo;&nbsp; Think of the mingling of the drudgery
of the Dryasdust with the movements of an imaginative vision
unsurpassed in our time; think, I say, of the collaborating of
the &lsquo;V&ouml;lsunga Saga&rsquo; with the
&lsquo;Nibelungenlied,&rsquo; the choosing of this point from the
Saga-man, and of that point from the later poem of the Germans,
and then fusing the whole by imaginative heat into the greatest
epic of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Was there not work enough
here for a considerable portion of a <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>poet&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; And yet so great is the entire
mass of his work that &lsquo;Sigurd&rsquo; is positively
overlooked in many of the notices of his writings which have
appeared since his death in the press, while in the others it is
alluded to in three words, and this simply because the mass of
other matter to be dealt with fills up all the available space of
a newspaper.</p>
<p>Then, again, take his translation of the Odyssey.&nbsp; Some
competent critics are dissatisfied with this; yet in a certain
sense it is a triumph.&nbsp; The two specially Homeric
qualities&mdash;those, indeed, which set Homer apart from all
other poets&mdash;are eagerness and dignity.&nbsp; Never again
can they be fully combined, for never again will poetry be
written in the Greek hexameters and by a Homer.&nbsp; That
Tennyson could have given us the Homeric dignity his magnificent
rendering of a famous fragment of the Iliad shows.&nbsp;
Chapman&rsquo;s translations show that the eagerness also can be
caught.&nbsp; Morris, of course, could not have given the dignity
of Homer, but then, while Tennyson has left us only a few lines
speaking with the dignity of the Iliad, Morris gave us a
translation of the entire Odyssey, which, though it missed the
Homeric dignity, secured the eagerness as completely as
Chapman&rsquo;s free-and-easy paraphrase, and in a rendering as
literal as Buckley&rsquo;s prose crib, which lay frankly by
Morris&rsquo;s side as he wrote.</p>
<p><!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>This, with his much less satisfactory translation of
Virgil, where he gives us an almost word-for-word translation,
and yet throws over the poem a glamour of romance which brings
Virgil into the sympathy of the modern reader, would have
occupied years with almost any other poet.&nbsp; But these two
efforts of his genius are swamped by the purely original poems,
such as &lsquo;The Defence of Guenevere,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Jason,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Earthly Paradise,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Love is Enough,&rsquo; &lsquo;Poems by the Way,&rsquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; And then come his translations from the
Icelandic.&nbsp; Mere translation is, of course, easy enough, but
not such translation as that in the &ldquo;Saga
Library.&rdquo;&nbsp; Allowing for all the aid he got from Mr.
Magn&uacute;sson, what a work this is!&nbsp; Think of the
imaginative exercise required to turn the language of these
Saga-men into a diction so picturesque and so concrete as to make
each Saga an English poem, for poem each one is, if Aristotle is
right in thinking that imaginative substance and not metre is the
first requisite of a poem.</p>
<p>And this brings me to those poems without metre which he
invented for himself in the latter portion of his career.&nbsp;
There is in these delightful stories, leaving out of
consideration the exquisite lyrics interspersed, enough poetic
wealth adequately to endow a dozen poets.&nbsp; The last of all
of them&mdash;the one of which the last two chapters, when he
could no longer <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>hold a pen, he dictated to his
friend Mr. Cockerell, in the determination, as he said to me,
that he would finish it before he died&mdash;will be found to be
finer than any hitherto published.&nbsp; It is called &lsquo;The
Sundering Flood,&rsquo; and was written after the story
&lsquo;The Water of the Wondrous Isles.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
(&lsquo;The Sundering Flood&rsquo;) is as long as &lsquo;The Wood
beyond the World,&rsquo; but has lyrics interspersed.</p>
<p>But evidently it is as an inventor in the fine arts that he is
chiefly known to the general public.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had he written
no poetry at all, he would have been as famous,&rdquo; we are
told, &ldquo;as he is now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyhow, there is no
household of any culture among the English-speaking races in
which the name of William Morris does not at once call up that
great revival in decorative art for which the latter part of the
nineteenth century will be famous.&nbsp; In his designs for
tapestry and other textures, in his designs for wall-papers and
furniture, there is an expenditure of imaginative force which
alone might make the fame of an artist.&nbsp; Then his artistic
printing, in which he invented his own decorations, his own type,
and his own paper&mdash;think of the energy he put into all
that!&nbsp; The moment that this new interest seized him he made
a more thorough study of the various specimens of black-letter
printing than had ever been made before save by
specialists.&nbsp; But even this could not &ldquo;fatigue an
appetite&rdquo; <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>for the joy of work &ldquo;which was
insatiable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He started as an apostle of
Socialism.&nbsp; He edited <i>The Commonweal</i>, and wrote
largely in it, sank money in it week by week with the greatest
glee, stumped the country as a Socialist orator, and into that
cause alone put the energy of three men.&nbsp; Is it any wonder,
then, that those who loved him were appalled at this prodigious
output?&nbsp; Often and often have I tried to bring this matter
before him.&nbsp; It was all of no use.&nbsp; &ldquo;For me to
rest from work,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;means to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When not absorbed in some occupation that he loved&mdash;and
in no other would he move&mdash;his restlessness was that of a
young animal.&nbsp; In conversation he could rarely sit still for
ten consecutive minutes, but must needs spring from his seat and
walk round the room, as if every limb were eager to take part in
the talk.&nbsp; His boisterous restlessness was the first thing
that struck strangers.&nbsp; During the period when the famous
partnership of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. was being
dissolved I saw him very frequently at Queen&rsquo;s Square, for
I took a very active part in the arrangement of that matter, and
after our interviews at Queen Square he and I used often to lunch
together at the &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; in Fleet Street.&nbsp; He
liked a sanded floor and quaint old-fashioned settles.&nbsp;
Moreover, the chops were the finest to be had in London.</p>
<p><!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>On the day following our first forgathering at the
&ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; I was lunching there with another
poet&mdash;a friend of his&mdash;when the waiter, who knew me
well, said, &ldquo;That was a loudish gent a-lunching with you
yesterday, sir.&nbsp; I thought once you was a-coming to
blows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Morris had merely been declaiming against the
Elizabethan dramatists, especially Cyril Tourneur.&nbsp; He
shouted out, &ldquo;You ought to know better than to claim any
merit for such work as &lsquo;The Atheist&rsquo;s
Tragedy&rsquo;&rdquo;; and wound up with the generalization that
&ldquo;the use of blank verse as a poetic medium ought to be
stopped by Act of Parliament for at least two
generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion, when Middleton
(another fine spirit, who &ldquo;should have died
hereafter&rdquo;) and I were staying with him at Kelmscott Manor,
the passionate emphasis with which he declared that the curse of
mankind was civilization, and that Australia ought to have been
left to the blacks, New Zealand to the Maoris, and South Africa
to the Kaffirs, startled even Middleton, who knew him so
well.</p>
<p>It was this boisterous energy and infinite enjoyment of life
which made it so difficult for people on meeting him for the
first time to associate him with the sweet sadness of &lsquo;The
Earthly Paradise.&rsquo;&nbsp; How could a man of such exuberant
animal spirits as Morris&mdash;so hearty, so noisy often, and
often so humorous&mdash;have written those lovely poems, whose
only fault <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>was an occasional languor and a lack
of humour often commented on when the critic compares him with
Chaucer?&nbsp; This subject of Chaucer&rsquo;s humour and
Morris&rsquo;s lack of it demands, however, a special word even
in so brief a notice as this.&nbsp; No man of our time&mdash;not
even Rossetti&mdash;had a finer appreciation of humour than
Morris, as is well known to those who heard him read aloud the
famous &ldquo;Rainbow Scene&rdquo; in &lsquo;Silas Marner&rsquo;
and certain passages in Charles Dickens&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp;
These readings were as fine as Rossetti&rsquo;s recitations of
&lsquo;Jim Bludso&rsquo; and other specimens of Yankee
humour.&nbsp; And yet it is a common remark, and one that cannot
be gainsaid, that there is no spark of humour in the published
poems of either of these two friends.&nbsp; Did it never occur to
any critic to ask whether the anomaly was not explicable by some
theory of poetic art that they held in common?&nbsp; It is no
disparagement to say of Morris that when he began to write poetry
the influence of Rossetti&rsquo;s canons of criticism upon him
was enormous, notwithstanding the influence upon him of
Browning&rsquo;s dramatic methods.&nbsp; But while
Rossetti&rsquo;s admiration of Browning was very strong, it was a
canon of his criticism that humour was, if not out of place in
poetry, a disturbing element of it.</p>
<p>What makes me think that Morris was greatly influenced by this
canon is the fact that Morris could and did write humorous
poetry, and then <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>withheld it from publication.&nbsp;
For the splendid poem of &lsquo;Sir Peter Harpdon&rsquo;s
End,&rsquo; printed in his first volume, Morris wrote a humorous
scene of the highest order, in which the hero said to his
faithful fellow captive and follower John Curzon that as their
deaths were so near he felt a sudden interest in what had never
interested him before&mdash;the story of John&rsquo;s life before
they had been brought so close to each other.&nbsp; The heroic
but dull-witted soldier acceded to his master&rsquo;s request,
and the incoherent, muddle-headed way in which he gave his
autobiography was full of a dramatic and subtle humour&mdash;was
almost worthy of him who in three or four words created the
foolish fat scullion in &lsquo;Tristram Shandy.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
he refused to print, in deference, I suspect, to a theory of
poetic art.</p>
<p>In criticizing Morris, however, the critic is apt to forget
that among poets there are those who, treating poetry simply as
an art, do not press into their work any more of their own
individual forces than the work artistically demands, while
another class of poets are impelled to give full expression to
themselves in every poem they write.&nbsp; It is to the former
class of poets that Morris belongs.</p>
<p>Whatever chanced to be Morris&rsquo;s goal of the moment was
pursued by him with as much intensity as though the universe
contained no other possible goal, and then, when the moment <!--
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>was passed, another goal received all his
attention.&nbsp; I was never more struck with this than on the
memorable day when I first met him, and was blessed with a
friendship that lasted without interruption for nearly a quarter
of a century.&nbsp; It was shortly after he and Rossetti entered
upon the joint occupancy of Kelmscott Manor on the Thames, where
I was staying as Rossetti&rsquo;s guest.&nbsp; On a certain
morning when we were walking in the fields Rossetti told me that
Morris was coming down for a day&rsquo;s fishing with George
Hake, and that &ldquo;Mouse,&rdquo; the Icelandic pony, was to be
sent to the Lechlade railway station to meet them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are now going to be introduced to my fellow
partner,&rdquo; Rossetti said.&nbsp; At that time I only knew of
the famous firm by name, and I asked Rossetti for an explanation,
which he gave in his usual incisive way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one evening a lot of us
were together, and we got talking about the way in which artists
did all kinds of things in olden times, designed every kind of
decoration and most kinds of furniture, and some one
suggested&mdash;as a joke more than anything else&mdash;that we
should each put down five pounds and form a company.&nbsp; Fivers
were blossoms of a rare growth among us in those days, and I
won&rsquo;t swear that the table bristled with fivers.&nbsp;
Anyhow, the firm was formed, but of course there was no deed, or
anything of that kind.&nbsp; In fact, <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>it was a
mere playing at business, and Morris was elected manager, not
because we ever dreamed he would turn out a man of business, but
because he was the only one among us who had both time and money
to spare.&nbsp; We had no idea whatever of commercial success,
but it succeeded almost in our own despite.&nbsp; Here comes the
manager.&nbsp; You must mind your <i>p&rsquo;s</i> and
<i>q&rsquo;s</i> with him; he is a wonderfully stand-off chap,
and generally manages to take against people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he like?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the portraits of Francis I.&nbsp; Well, take
that portrait as the basis of what you would call in your
metaphysical jargon your &lsquo;mental image&rsquo; of the
manager&rsquo;s face, soften down the nose a bit, and give him
the rose-bloom colour of an English farmer, and there you have
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Francis&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are not quite so small, but not
big&mdash;blue-grey, but full of genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I saw, coming towards us on a rough pony so
diminutive that he well deserved the name of &ldquo;Mouse,&rdquo;
the figure of a man in a wideawake&mdash;a figure so broad and
square that the breeze at his back, soft and balmy as it was,
seemed to be using him as a sail, and blowing both him and the
pony towards us.</p>
<p>When Rossetti introduced me, the manager greeted him with a
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I thought you were <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; This did not seem promising.&nbsp;
Morris at that time was as proverbial for his exclusiveness as he
afterwards became for his expansiveness.</p>
<p>Rossetti, however, was irresistible to everybody, and
especially to Morris, who saw that he was expected to be
agreeable to me, and most agreeable he was, though for at least
an hour I could still see the shy look in the corner of his
eyes.&nbsp; He invited me to join the fishing, which I did.&nbsp;
Finding every faculty of Morris&rsquo;s mind and every nerve in
his body occupied with one subject, fishing, I (coached by
Rossetti, who warned me not to talk about &lsquo;The Defence of
Guenevere&rsquo;) talked about nothing but the bream, roach,
dace, and gudgeon I used to catch as a boy in the Ouse, and the
baits that used to tempt the victims to their doom.&nbsp; Not one
word passed Morris&rsquo;s lips, as far as I remember at this
distance of time, which had not some relation to fish and
baits.&nbsp; He had come from London for a few hours&rsquo;
fishing, and all the other interests which as soon as he got back
to Queen&rsquo;s Square would be absorbing him were
forgotten.&nbsp; Instead of watching my float, I could not help
watching his face with an amused interest at its absorbed
expression, which after a while he began to notice, and the
following little dialogue ensued, which I remember as though it
took place yesterday:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old were you when you used to fish in the
Ouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&ldquo;Oh, all sorts of ages; it was at all sorts of
times, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how young then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say ten or twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you got a bite at ten or twelve, did you get as
interested, as excited, as I get when I see my float
bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way in which he said, &ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo;
conveyed a world of disparagement of me as a man who could care
to gaze upon a brother angler instead of upon his own float.</p>
<h3><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span

<p>In whatsoever William Morris does or says the hand or the
voice of the poet is seen or heard: in his house decorations no
less than in his epics, in his illuminated manuscripts no less
than in his tapestries, in his philippics against
&ldquo;restoration&rdquo; no less than in his sage-greens, in his
socialism no less than in his samplers.&nbsp; And first a word as
to his poetry.&nbsp; Any critic who, having for contemporaries
such writers as Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, and William
Morris, fails to see that he lives in a period of great poets may
rest assured that he is a critic born&mdash;may rest assured that
had he lived in the days of the Elizabethans he would have joined
the author of &lsquo;The Returne from Parnassus&rsquo; in
despising the unacademic author of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Lear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Among this band of great contemporary
poets what is the special position held by him who, having set
his triumphant hand to everything from the sampler up to the
epic, has now, by way of recreation, or rather by way of opening
a necessary safety-valve to ease his restless energies, invented
a system of poetic socialism and expounded it in a brand-new kind
of prose fiction?</p>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>A special and peculiar position Morris holds among his
peers&mdash;on that we are all agreed; but what is that
position?&nbsp; We must not talk too familiarly about the
Olympian gods; but is it that, without being the greatest where
all are great, Morris is the one who on all occasions produces
pure poetry and nothing else?&nbsp; Without affirming that it is
so, we may at least ask the question.&nbsp; If other poets of our
time show more intellectual strength than he, are they,
perchance, given sometimes to adulterating their poetry with
ratiocination and didactic preachments such as were better left
to the proseman?&nbsp; Without affirming that it is so, we may at
least ask the question.&nbsp; If other poets of our time can
reach a finer frenzy than he and give it voice with a more
melodious throat, are they, perchance, apt to forget that
&ldquo;eloquence is heard while poetry is overheard&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Without affirming that it is so, we may at least ask the
question.&nbsp; If others, again, are more picturesque than he
(though these it might be difficult to find), are they,
perchance, a little too self-conscious in their word-pictures,
and are they, perchance, apt to pass into those flowery but
uncertain ways that were first discovered by Euphues?&nbsp;
Without affirming that it is so, we may at least ask the
question.</p>
<p>But supposing that we really had to affirm all these things
about the other Olympians, where then would be the position of
him about whose <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>work such questions could not even
be asked?&nbsp; Where would then be the place of him who never
passes into ratiocination or rhetoric, never passes into
excessive word-painting or into euphuism, never speaks so loud as
to be heard rather than overheard, but, on the contrary, gives us
always clear and simple pictures, and always in musical
language?&nbsp; Where would then be the place of him who is the
very ideal, if not of the poet as <i>vates</i>, yet of the poet
as &ldquo;maker&rdquo;&mdash;the poet who always looks out upon
life through a poetic atmosphere which, if sometimes more
attenuated than suits some readers, is as simple and as clear as
the air of a May morning?&nbsp; A question which would be
variously answered according to the various temperaments of those
who answer&mdash;of those who define poetry to be
&ldquo;making,&rdquo; or those who define it to be
&ldquo;prophesying,&rdquo; or those who define it to be
&ldquo;singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exception has, no doubt, been taken to certain archaisms in
which Morris indulges not only in the epic of
&lsquo;Sigurd,&rsquo; but also, and in a greater degree, in his
translations, especially in that rendering of the Odyssey.&nbsp;
It is not our business here to examine into the merits and
demerits of Morris as a translator; but if it were, this is what
we should say on his behalf.&nbsp; While admitting that now and
again his diction is a little too Scandinavian to be in colour,
we should point to Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>dictum that
in a versified translation a poet is no longer recognizable, and
then we should ask whether it is given to any man in any kind of
diction to translate Homer.&nbsp; One Homeric quality only can
any one translator secure, it seems; and if he can secure one, is
not his partial failure better than success in less ambitious
efforts?&nbsp; To Chapman it was given to secure in the Iliad a
measure of the Homeric eagerness&mdash;but what else?&nbsp; To
Tennyson (in one wonderful fragment) it was given to secure a
measure of the Homeric dignity and also a measure of the Homeric
picture&mdash;but what else?&nbsp; There was still left one of
the three supreme Homeric qualities&mdash;the very quality which
no one ever supposed could be secured for our literature, or,
indeed, for any other&mdash;Homer&rsquo;s quality of
<i>na&iuml;f</i> wonder.&nbsp; There is no witchery of Homer so
fascinating as this; and did any one suppose that it could ever
be caught by any translator?&nbsp; And could it ever have been
caught had not Nature in one of her happiest moods bethought
herself of evolving, in a late and empty day, the industrious
tapestry weaver of Merton and idle singer of
&lsquo;Sigurd,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Earthly Paradise,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Love is Enough,&rsquo; and ten thousand delightful verses
besides?</p>
<p>But can a writer be called <i>na&iuml;f</i> who works in a
diction belonging rather to a past age than to his own?&nbsp;
Morris has proved that he could.&nbsp; Imagination is the basis
upon which all other <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>human faculties rest.&nbsp; In the
deep sense, indeed, one possession only have we &ldquo;fools of
nature,&rdquo; our imagination.&nbsp; What we fondly take for
substance is the very shadow; what we fondly take for shadow is
the very substance.&nbsp; And day by day is Science herself
endorsing more emphatically than ever Hamlet&rsquo;s dictum, that
&ldquo;there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the aid of imagination our souls confront the
present, and, as a rule, the present only.&nbsp; But Morris is an
instance, and not a solitary one, of a modern writer&rsquo;s
inhaling so naturally the atmosphere of the particular past
period his imagination delights in as to belong spiritually to
that period rather than his own.&nbsp; To deny sincerity of
accent to Morris because of his love of the simple old
Scandinavian note&mdash;the note which to him represents every
other kind of primitive simplicity&mdash;would be as uncritical
as to deny sincerity of accent to Charles Lamb because of his
sympathy with Elizabethan and Jacobean times, or to Dante
Rossetti because of his sympathy with the period of his great
Italian namesake.</p>
<p>So much for the poetry of our many-handed poet.&nbsp; As to
his house decorations, his illuminated manuscripts, his
&ldquo;anti-scrape&rdquo; philippics, his sage-greens, his
tapestries, his socialism, and his samplers: to deal with the
infinite is far beyond the scope of an article so <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>very finite as this, or we could easily show that in
them all there is seen the same <i>na&iuml;f</i> genius of the
poet, the same rare instinct for beautiful expression, the same
originality as in the epics and the translations.&nbsp; Let him
who is rash enough to suppose that even the socialism of a great
poet is like the socialism of common folk read &lsquo;John
Ball.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let him observe how like Titania floating and
dancing and playing among the Athenian clowns seems the Morrisian
genius floating and dancing and playing among the surroundings in
which at present it pleases him to disport.&nbsp; What makes the
ordinary socialistic literature to many people unreadable is its
sourness.&nbsp; What the Socialists say may be true, but their
way of saying it sets one&rsquo;s teeth on edge.&nbsp; They
contrive to state their case with so much bitterness, with so
much unfairness&mdash;so much lack of logic&mdash;that the
listener says at once, &ldquo;For me, <i>any</i> galley but
this!&nbsp; Things <i>are</i> bad; but, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake,
let us go on as we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the clever competition of organisms did Nature, long before
socialism was thought of, contrive to build up a world&mdash;this
makeshift world.&nbsp; By the teeth of her very cats did she
evolve her succulent clover.&nbsp; But whether the Socialists are
therefore wrong in their views of society and its ultimate goal
is not a question we need discuss.&nbsp; What they want is more
knowledge and less zeal.&nbsp; It is <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>possible to
see, and see clearly, that the social organism is far from being
what it ought to be, and at the same time to remember that man is
a creature of slow growth, and that even in reaching his present
modest stage of development the time he required was
long&mdash;long indeed unless we consider his history in relation
to the history of the earth, and then he appears to have been
very commendably expeditious.&nbsp; If there is any truth in what
the geologists tell us of the vast age of the earth, it seems
only a few years ago that man succeeded, after much heroic
sitting down, in wearing off an appendage which had done him good
service in his early tree-climbing days, but which, with new
environments and with trousers in prospect, had ceased to be
useful or ornamental.&nbsp; An anthropoid Socialist would have
advised him to &ldquo;cut it off,&rdquo; and had he done so he
would have bled to death.</p>
<p>That among all her children Man is really Nature&rsquo;s prime
favourite seems pretty evident, though no one can say why.&nbsp;
It is to him that the Great Mother is ever pointing and saying,
&ldquo;A poor creature, but mine own.&nbsp; I shall do something
with him some day, but I must not try to force him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here, indeed, is the mistake of the Socialists.&nbsp; They think
they can force the very creature who above all others cannot be
forced.&nbsp; They think they can turn him into something rich
and strange&mdash;turn him in a <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>single
generation&mdash;even as certain ingenious experimentalists
turned what Nature meant for a land-salamander into a
water-salamander, with new rudder-tail and gills instead of lungs
and feet suppressed, by feeding him with water animals in
oxygenated water and cajoling his functions.&nbsp; Competition,
that evolved Shakespeare from an ascidian, may be a mistake of
Nature&rsquo;s&mdash;M. Ars&egrave;ne Houssaye declares that she
never was so wise and artistically perfect as we take her to
be&mdash;but her mistakes are too old to be rectified in a single
generation.&nbsp; A little more knowledge, we say, and a little
less zeal would save the Socialist from being considered by the
advanced thinker&mdash;who, studying the present by the light of
the past, sees that all civilization is provisional&mdash;as the
most serious obstructive whom he has to encounter.</p>
<p>As to Morris, we have always felt that, take him all round, he
is the richest and most varied in artistic endowments of any man
of our time.&nbsp; On whichsoever of the fine arts he had chanced
to concentrate his gifts and energies the result would have been
the same as in poetry.&nbsp; In the front rank he would always
have been.&nbsp; But it is not until we come to deal with his
socialism that we see how entirely aestheticism is the primal
source from which all his energies spring.&nbsp; That he has a
great and generous heart&mdash;a heart that must needs sympathize
with every form of distress&mdash;no one can doubt who <!-- page
263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>reads these two books, <a name="citation263"></a><a
href="#footnote263" class="citation">[263]</a> and yet his
socialism comes from an entirely &aelig;sthetic impulse.&nbsp; It
is the vulgarities of civilization, it is the ugliness of
contemporary life&mdash;so unlike that Earthly Paradise of the
poetic dream&mdash;that have driven him from his natural and
proper work.&nbsp; He cannot take offence at our saying this, for
he has said it himself in &lsquo;Signs of
Change&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As I strove to stir up people to this
reform, I found that the causes of the vulgarities of
civilization lay deeper than I had thought, and little by little
I was driven to the conclusion that all these uglinesses are but
the outward expression of the innate moral baseness into which we
are forced by our present form of society, and that it is futile
to attempt to deal with them from the outside.&nbsp; Whatever I
have written, or spoken on the platform, on these social subjects
is the result of the truths of socialism meeting my earlier
impulse, and giving it a definite and much more serious aim; and
I can only hope, in conclusion, that any of my readers who have
found themselves hard-pressed by the sordidness of civilization,
and have not known where to turn to for encouragement, may
receive the same enlightenment as I have, and that even the rough
pieces in this book may help them to that end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these eloquent words no one can more fully agree than we
do, so far as they relate to the unloveliness of Philistine
rule.&nbsp; But <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>though the bad features of the
present time <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> are peculiar to itself, when were
those paradisal days of which Morris dreams? when did that merry
England exist in which the general sum of human happiness and
human misery was more equally distributed than now?</p>
<p>Those &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; beloved of the author of
&lsquo;John Ball&rsquo; may not have been quite so dark as
Swinburne declares them to have been; but in this matter of the
equalization of human happiness were they so very far in advance
of the present time?&nbsp; Those who have watched the progress of
Morris&rsquo;s socialism know that, so far from being out of
keeping with the &ldquo;anti-scrape&rdquo; philippics and the
tapestry weaving, it is in entire harmony with them.&nbsp; Out of
a noble anger against the &ldquo;jerry builder&rdquo; and his
detestable doings sprang this the last of the Morrisian epics, as
out of the wrath of Achilles sprang the Iliad.&nbsp; That the
picturesqueness of the John Ball period should lead captive the
imagination of Morris was, of course, inevitable.&nbsp; Society
is at least picturesque wheresoever the classes are so sharply
demarcated as they were in the dark ages, when the difference as
to quality of flesh and blood between the lord and the thrall was
greater than the difference between the thrall and the swine he
tended.&nbsp; But what about the condition of this same
picturesque thrall who (as the law books have it) <!-- page
265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>&ldquo;clothed the soil&rdquo;&mdash;whose every chance
of happiness, whose every chance of comfort, depended upon the
arbitrary will of some more or less brutal lord?&nbsp; What was
the condition of the English lower orders&mdash;the orders for
whom many bitter social tears are now being shed?&nbsp; What
about the condition of the thralls in dark ages so dark that even
an apostle of Wyclif&rsquo;s (this same John Ball, Morris&rsquo;s
hero) preached the doctrine&mdash;unless he has been
belied&mdash;that no child had a soul that could be saved who had
been born out of wedlock?&nbsp; The Persian aphorism that warns
us to beware of poets, princes, and women must have had a
satirical reference to the fact that their governance of the
world is by means of picturesqueness.&nbsp; Always it has been
the picturesqueness of tyranny that has kept it up.&nbsp; It was
the picturesqueness of the <i>auto de fe</i> that kept up the
Spanish Inquisition, but we may rest assured that the most
picturesque actors in that striking tableau would have preferred
a colourless time of jerry builders to a picturesqueness like
that.&nbsp; To find a fourteenth-century pothouse parlour painted
by a modern Socialist with a hand more loving than Walter
Scott&rsquo;s own is indeed touching:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I entered the door and started at first
with my old astonishment, with which I had woke up, so strange
and beautiful did this interior seem to me, though it was but a
pothouse <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>parlour.&nbsp; A quaintly carved
sideboard held an array of bright pewter pots and dishes and
wooden and earthen bowls; a stout oak table went up and down the
room, and a carved oak chair stood by the chimney-corner, now
filled by a very old man dim-eyed and white-bearded.&nbsp; That,
except the rough stools and benches on which the company sat, was
all the furniture.&nbsp; The walls were panelled roughly enough
with oak boards to about six feet from the floor, and about three
feet of plaster above that was wrought in a pattern of a rose
stem running all round the room, freely and roughly done, but
with (as it seemed to my unused eyes) wonderful skill and
spirit.&nbsp; On the hood of the great chimney a huge rose was
wrought in the plaster and brightly painted in its proper
colours.&nbsp; There were a dozen or more of the men I had seen
coming along the street sitting there, some eating and all
drinking; their cased bows leaned against the wall, their quivers
hung on pegs in the panelling, and in a corner of the room I saw
half a dozen bill-hooks that looked made more for war than for
hedge-shearing, with ashen handles some seven foot long.&nbsp;
Three or four children were running about among the legs of the
men, heeding them mighty little in their bold play, and the men
seemed little troubled by it, although they were talking
earnestly and seriously too.&nbsp; A well-made comely girl leaned
up against the chimney close to the gaffer&rsquo;s chair, and
seemed to be in waiting on the company: she was clad in a
close-fitting gown of bright blue cloth, with a broad silver
girdle, daintily wrought, round her loins, a rose <!-- page
267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>wreath was on her head, and her hair hung down unbound;
the gaffer grumbled a few words to her from time to time, so that
I judged he was her grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Morris&rsquo;s &lsquo;Earthly Paradise&rsquo;!&rdquo;
the reader will exclaim.&nbsp; Yes; and here we come upon that
feature of originality which, as has been before said,
distinguishes Morris&rsquo;s socialism from the socialism of the
prosaic reformer.</p>
<p>Political opinions almost always spring from
temperament.&nbsp; The conservative temper of such a poet as Sir
Walter Scott leads him to idealize the past, and to concern
himself but little about the future.&nbsp; The rebellious
temperament of such a poet as Shelley leads him to idealize the
future, and concern himself but little about the past.&nbsp; But
by contriving to idealize both the past and the future, and
mixing the two idealizations into one delicious amalgam, the poet
of the &lsquo;Earthly Paradise&rsquo; gives us the Morrisian
socialism, the most charming, and in many respects the most
marvellous product of &ldquo;the poet&rsquo;s mind&rdquo; that
has ever yet been presented to an admiring world.</p>
<p>The plan of &lsquo;John Ball&rsquo; is simplicity
itself.&nbsp; The poet in a dream becomes a spectator of the
insurrection of the Kentish men at the time when Wat Tyler
rebelled against the powers that were; and the hero, John Ball,
who is mainly famous as having preached a sermon from the
text</p>
<blockquote><p>Wan Adam dalf and Eve span<br />
Wo was thanne a gentilman?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>is made to listen to the poet-dreamer&rsquo;s prophecy
of the days of <i>bourgeois</i> rule and the jerry builder.</p>
<p>If we take into account the perfect truth and beauty of the
literary form in which the story is presented, we do not believe
that anything to surpass it could be found in historic fiction;
indeed, we do not know that anything could be found to equal
it.&nbsp; The difficulty of the imaginative writer who attempts,
whether in prose or verse, to vivify the past seems to be
increasing, as we have before said, every day with the growth of
the scientific temper and the reverence of the sacredness of mere
documents.&nbsp; The old-fashioned theory&mdash;the theory which
obtained from Shakespeare&rsquo;s time down to Scott&rsquo;s and
even down to Kingsley&rsquo;s&mdash;that the facts of history
could be manipulated for artistic purposes with the same freedom
that the artist&rsquo;s own inventions can be handled, gave the
artist power to produce vital and flexible work at the expense of
the historic conscience&mdash;a power which is being curtailed
day by day.&nbsp; The instinct for vivifying by imaginative
treatment the records of the past is too universal and too deeply
inwoven in the very texture of the human mind to be other than a
true and healthy instinct.&nbsp; But so oppressive has become the
tyranny of documents, so fettered by what a humourist has called
&ldquo;factology&rdquo; have become the wings of the
romancer&rsquo;s imagination, that <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>one wonders
at his courage in dealing with historic subjects at all.</p>
<p>A bold writer would he be who in the present day should make
Shakespeare figure among the Kenilworth festivities as a famous
player (after the manner of Scott), or who should (after the
manner of Kingsley) give Elizabeth credit for Winter&rsquo;s
device of using the fire-ships before Calais.&nbsp; Even the
poet&mdash;he who, dealing as he does with essential and
elemental qualities only, is not so hampered as the proseman in
these matters&mdash;is beginning also to feel the tyranny of
documents, as we see notably in Swinburne&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Bothwell,&rsquo; which consists very largely of documents
transfigured into splendid verse.&nbsp; But more than even this:
the mere literary form has now to be as true to the time depicted
as circumstances will allow.&nbsp; If Scott&rsquo;s romances have
a fault it is that, as he had no command over, and perhaps but
little sympathy with, the beautiful old English of which Morris
is such a master, his stories lack one important element of
dramatic illusion.&nbsp; But it is in the literary form of his
story that Morris is especially successful.&nbsp; Where time has
dealt most cruelly with our beloved language is in robbing it of
that beautiful cadence which fell from our forefathers&rsquo;
lips as sweetly and as unconsciously as melody falls from the
throat of the mavis.&nbsp; One of the many advantages that Morris
has reaped from his peculiar line of study is that he can <!--
page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>write like this&mdash;he, and he alone among living
men:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Surely thou goest to thy
death.&rsquo;&nbsp; He smiled very sweetly, yet proudly, as he
said: &lsquo;Yea, the road is long, but the end cometh at
last.&nbsp; Friend, many a day have I been dying; for my sister,
with whom I have played and been merry in the autumntide about
the edges of the stubble-fields; and we gathered the nuts and
bramble-berries there, and started thence the missel-thrush, and
wondered at his voice and thought him big; and the sparrow-hawk
wheeled and turned over the hedges, and the weasel ran across the
path, and the sound of the sheep-bells came to us from the downs
as we sat happy on the grass; and she is dead and gone from the
earth, for she pined from famine after the years of the great
sickness; and my brother was slain in the French wars, and none
thanked him for dying save he that stripped him of his gear; and
my unwedded wife with whom I dwelt in love after I had taken the
tonsure, and all men said she was good and fair, and true she was
and lovely; she also is dead and gone from the earth; and why
should I abide save for the deeds of the flesh which must be
done?&nbsp; Truly, friend, this is but an old tale that men must
die; and I will tell thee another, to wit, that they live: and I
live now and shall live.&nbsp; Tell me then what shall
befall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the music of the cadence here&mdash;a music that plays
about the heart more sweetly than any verse, save the very
highest.&nbsp; And here we touch upon an extremely interesting
subject.</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>Always in reading a prose story by a writer whose
energies have been exercised in other departments of letters
there is for the critic a special interest.&nbsp; If this
exercise has been in fields outside imaginative
literature&mdash;in those fields of philosophical speculation
where a logical method and a scientific modulation of sentences
are required&mdash;the novelist, instead of presenting us with
those concrete pictures of human life demanded in all imaginative
art, is apt to give us disquisitions &ldquo;about and
about&rdquo; human life.&nbsp; Forgetting that it is not the
function of any art to prove, he is apt to concern himself deeply
in showing why his actors did and said this or that&mdash;apt to
busy himself about proving his story either by subtle analyses or
else by purely scientific generalizations, instead of attending
to the true method of convincement that belongs to his
art&mdash;the convincement that is effected by actual pictorial
and dramatic illustration of how his actors really did the things
and said the things vouched for by his own imagination.&nbsp;
That the quest of a scientific, or supposed scientific, basis for
a novelist&rsquo;s imaginative structure is fatal to true art is
seen not only in George Eliot and the accomplished author of
&lsquo;Elsie Venner,&rsquo; but also in writers of another
kind&mdash;writers whose hands cannot possibly have been
stiffened by their knowledge of science.</p>
<p>Among the many instances that occur to us <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>we need
point to only one, that of a story recently published by one of
our most successful living novelists, in which the writer
endeavours to prove that animal magnetism is the acting cause of
spiritualistic manifestations so called.&nbsp; Setting out to
show that a medium is nothing more than a powerful mesmerist, to
whose manipulations all but two in a certain household are
unconsciously succumbing, he soon ignores for plot purposes the
nature of the dramatic situation by making those very two
sceptics at a s&eacute;ance hear the same music, see the same
spiritually conveyed newspaper, as the others hear and see.&nbsp;
That the writer should mistake, as he seems to do, the merely
directive force of magnetism for a motive force does not concern
the literary critic.&nbsp; But when two sceptics, who are to
expose a charlatan&rsquo;s tricks by watching how the believers
are succumbing to mesmeric hallucinations, are found succumbing
to the same hallucinations themselves&mdash;succumbing because
the story-teller needs them as witnesses of the
phenomena&mdash;then the literary critic grows pensive, for he
sees what havoc the scientific method will work in the
flower-garden of art.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should the story-teller be a poet&mdash;one
who, like the writer of &lsquo;John Ball,&rsquo; has been
accustomed to write under the conditions of a form of literary
art where the diction is always and necessarily concrete, <!--
page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>figurative, and quintessential, and where the movement
is metrical&mdash;his danger lies in a very different
direction.&nbsp; The critic&rsquo;s interest then lies in
watching how the poet will comport himself in another field of
imaginative literature&mdash;a field where no such conditions as
these exist&mdash;a field where quintessential and concrete
diction, though meritorious, may yet be carried too far, and
where those regular and expected bars of the metricist which are
the first requisites of verse are not only without function, but
are in the way&mdash;are fatal, indeed, to that kind of
convincement which, and which alone, is the proper quest of prose
art.&nbsp; No doubt it is true, as we have before said, that
literature being nothing but the reflex of the life of man, or
else of the life of nature, the final quest of every form of
literature is that special kind of convincement which is
inherently suitable to the special form.&nbsp; For the analogy
between nature and true art is not a fanciful one, and the
relation of function to organism is the same in both.&nbsp; But
what is the difference between the convincement achieved by
poetic and the convincement achieved by prose art?&nbsp; Is it
that the convincement of him who works in poetic forms is, though
not necessarily, yet most perfectly achieved by a faithful record
of the emotion aroused in his own soul by the impact upon his
senses of the external world, while the convincement of the
proseman is, though not <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>necessarily, yet most perfectly achieved by a faithful
record and picture of the external world itself?</p>
<p>All such generalizations as this are, no doubt, to be taken
with many and great qualifications; but, roughly speaking, would
not this seem to be the fundamental difference between that kind
of imaginative literature which expresses itself in metrical
forms and that kind of imaginative literature in which metrical
form is replaced by other qualities and other functions?&nbsp;
Not but that these two methods may meet in the same work, not but
that they may meet and strengthen each other, as we have before
said when glancing at the interesting question, How much, or how
little, of realism can poetry capture from the world of prose and
weave into her magic woof, and how much of music can prose steal
from poetry?&nbsp; But in order to do all that can be done in the
way of enriching poetry with prose material without missing the
convincement of poetic art, the poet must be Homer himself; in
order to do all that can be done in the way of vivifying prose
fiction with poetic fire without missing the convincement of
prose art, the story-teller must be Charlotte Bront&euml; or
Emily, her sister, in whose work we find for once the
quintessential strength and the concrete and figurative diction
of the poet&mdash;indeed, all the poetical requisites save metre
alone.&nbsp; Had &lsquo;Jane Eyre,&rsquo; &lsquo;Villette,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Wuthering <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span

Coleridge&rsquo;s time he would, we may be sure, have taken these
three prose poems as illustrations of the truth of his axiom that
the true antithesis of poetry is not prose, but science.</p>
<p>What the prose poet has to avoid is metrical movement on the
one side and scientific modulation of sentences on the
other.&nbsp; And perhaps in no case can it be achieved save in
the autobiographic form of fiction, where and where alone the
work is so subjective that it may bear even the poetic glow of
&lsquo;Jane Eyre&rsquo; and &lsquo;Villette.&rsquo;&nbsp; What
makes us think this to be so is the fact that in
&lsquo;Shirley&rsquo;&mdash;a story written in the epic
method&mdash;the only passages of the poetic kind which really
convince are those uttered by the characters in their own
persons.&nbsp; And as to &lsquo;Wuthering Heights,&rsquo; a story
which could not, of course, be told in one autobiography, the
method of telling it by means of a group of autobiographies,
though clumsy enough from the constructor&rsquo;s point, was yet
just as effective as a more artistic method.&nbsp; And it was
true instinct of genius that led Emily Bront&euml; to adopt the
autobiographic method even under these heavy conditions.</p>
<p>Still the general truth remains that the primary function of
the poet is to tell his story steeped in his own emotion, while
the primary function of the prose fictionist is to tell his story
in an objective way.&nbsp; Hence it <!-- page 276--><a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>is that in
a general way the difficulty of the poet who turns to prose
fiction lies, like that of philosophical or scientific writers,
in suppressing certain intellectual functions which he has been
in the habit of exercising.&nbsp; And the case of Scott, which at
first sight might seem to show against this theory, may be
adduced in support of it.&nbsp; For Scott&rsquo;s versified
diction, though concrete, is never more quintessential than that
of prose; and his method being always objective rather than
subjective, when he turned to prose fiction he seemed at once to
be writing with his right hand where formerly he had been writing
with his left.</p>

GROOME.<br />
(THE TARNO RYE.)<br />
1851&ndash;1902.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>I have been invited to write about my late friend and
colleague Francis Hindes Groome, who died on the 24th ult., and
was buried among his forefathers at Monk Soham in Suffolk.&nbsp;
I find the task extremely difficult.&nbsp; Though he died at
fifty, he, with the single exception of Borrow, had lived more
than any other friend of mine, and perhaps suffered more.&nbsp;
Indeed, his was one of the most remarkable and romantic literary
lives that, since Borrow&rsquo;s, have been lived in my time.</p>
<p>The son of an Archdeacon of Suffolk, he was born in 1851 at
Monk Soham Rectory, where, I believe, his father and his
grandfather were born, and where they certainly lived;
for&mdash;as has been recorded in one of the invaluable registry
books of my friend Mr. F. A. Crisp&mdash;he belonged to one of
the oldest and most distinguished families in Suffolk.&nbsp; He
was sent early to Ipswich School, where he was a very popular
boy, but never <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>strong and never fond of athletic
exercises.&nbsp; His early taste for literature is shown by the
fact that with his boy friend Henry Elliot Maiden he originated a
school magazine called the <i>Elizabethan</i>.&nbsp; Like many an
organ originated in the outer world, the <i>Elizabethan</i>
failed because it would not, or could not, bring itself into
harmony with the public taste.&nbsp; The boys wanted news of
cricket and other games: Groome and his assistant editor gave
them literature as far as it was in their power to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Francis Hindes Groome" src="images/p278s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Ipswich School was a very good one for those who got into
the sixth, as Groome did.&nbsp; The head master, Dr. Holden, was
a very fine scholar; and it is no wonder that Groome throughout
his life showed a considerable knowledge of and interest in
classical literature.&nbsp; That he had a real insight into the
structure of Latin verse is seen by a rendering of
Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tithonus,&rsquo; which Mr. Maiden has
been so very good as to show me&mdash;a rendering for which he
got a prize.&nbsp; In 1869 he got prizes for classical
literature, Latin prose, Latin elegiacs, and Latin
hexameters.&nbsp; But if Dr. Holden exercised much influence over
Groome&rsquo;s taste, the assistant master, Mr. Sanderson,
certainly exercised more, for Mr. Sanderson was an enthusiastic
student of Romany.&nbsp; The influence of the assistant master
was soon seen after Groome went up to Oxford.&nbsp; He was
ploughed for his <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>&ldquo;Smalls,&rdquo; and, remaining
up for part of the &ldquo;Long,&rdquo; he went one night to a
fair at Oxford at which many gipsies were present&mdash;an
incident which forms an important part of his gipsy story
&lsquo;Kriegspiel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Groome at once struck up an
acquaintance with the gipsies at the fair.&nbsp; It occurred also
that Mr. Sanderson, after Groome had left Ipswich School, used to
go and stay at Monk Soham Rectory every summer for fishing; and
this tended to focus Groome&rsquo;s interest in Romany
matters.&nbsp; At G&ouml;ttingen, where he afterwards went, he
found himself in a kind of Romany atmosphere, for, owing perhaps
to Benfey&rsquo;s having been a G&ouml;ttingen man, Romany
matters were still somewhat rife there in certain sets.</p>
<p>The period from his leaving G&ouml;ttingen to his appearance
in Edinburgh in 1876 as a working literary man of amazing
activity, intelligence, and knowledge is the period that he spent
among the gipsies.&nbsp; And it is this very period of wild
adventure and romance that it is impossible for me to dwell upon
here.&nbsp; But on some future occasion I hope to write something
about his adventures as a Romany Rye.&nbsp; His first work was on
the &lsquo;Globe Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; edited by Dr. John
Ross.&nbsp; Even at that time he was very delicate and subject to
long wearisome periods of illness.&nbsp; During his work on the
&lsquo;Globe&rsquo; he fell seriously ill in the middle of the
letter <i>S</i>.&nbsp; Things were going <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>very badly
with him; but they would have gone much worse had it not been for
the affection and generosity of his friend and colleague Prof. H.
A. Webster, who, in order to get the work out in time, sat up
night after night in Groome&rsquo;s room, writing articles on
Sterne, Voltaire, and other subjects.</p>
<p>Webster&rsquo;s kindness, and afterwards the kindness of Dr.
Patrick, endeared Edinburgh and Scotland to the &ldquo;Tarno
Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Webster was at that time on the staff of
&lsquo;The Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; I think, but I
do not know, that it was through him that Groome got the
commission to write his article &lsquo;Gypsies&rsquo; in that
stupendous work.&nbsp; I do not know whether it is the most
important, but I do know that it is one of the most thorough and
conscientious articles in the entire encyclop&aelig;dia.&nbsp;
This was followed by his being engaged by Messrs. Jack to edit
the &lsquo;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland,&rsquo; a splendid
work, which on its completion was made the subject of a long and
elaborate article in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>&mdash;an article
which was a great means of directing attention to him, as he
always declared.&nbsp; Anyhow, people now began to inquire about
Groome.&nbsp; In 1880 he brought out &lsquo;In Gypsy
Tents,&rsquo; which I shall describe further on.&nbsp; In 1885 he
was chosen to join the staff of Messrs. W. &amp; R.
Chambers.&nbsp; It is curious to think of the &ldquo;Tarno
Rye,&rdquo; perhaps the most variously equipped <!-- page
281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>literary man in Europe, after such adventures as his,
sitting from 10 to 4 every day on the sub-editorial stool.&nbsp;
He was perfectly content on that stool, however, owing to the
genial kindness of his colleague.&nbsp; As sub-editor under Dr.
Patrick, and also as a very copious contributor, he took part in
the preparation of the new edition of &lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclop&aelig;dia.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took a large part also in
preparing &lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Gazetteer&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Biographical Dictionary.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Meanwhile he was writing articles in the &lsquo;Dictionary of
National Biography,&rsquo; articles in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> and <i>The Bookman</i>, and also reviews upon
special subjects in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p>This was followed in 1887 by a short Border history, crammed
with knowledge.&nbsp; In 1895 his name became really familiar to
the general reader by his delightful little volume &lsquo;Two
Suffolk Friends&rsquo;&mdash;sketches of his father and his
father&rsquo;s friend Edward FitzGerald&mdash;full of humour and
admirable character-drawing.</p>
<p>In 1896 he published his Romany novel
&lsquo;Kriegspiel,&rsquo; which did not meet with anything like
the success it deserved, although I must say he was himself in
some degree answerable for its comparative failure.&nbsp; The
origin of the story was this.&nbsp; Shortly after our intimacy I
told him that I had written a gipsy story dealing with the East
Anglian gipsies and the Welsh gipsies, but that it had been so
dinned <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>into me by Borrow that in England
there was no interest in the gipsies that I had never found heart
to publish it.&nbsp; Groome urged me to let him read it, and he
did read it, as far as it was then complete, and took an
extremely kind view of it, and urged me to bring it out.&nbsp;
But now came another and a new cause for delay in my bringing out
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;: Groome himself, who at that time knew more
about Romany matters than all other Romany students of my
acquaintance put together, showed a remarkable gift as a
<i>raconteur</i>, and I felt quite sure that he could, if he set
to work, write a Romany story&mdash;<i>the</i> Romany story of
the English language.&nbsp; He strongly resisted the idea for a
long time&mdash;for two or three years at least&mdash;and he was
only persuaded to undertake the task at last by my telling him
that I would never bring out my story until he brought out one
himself.&nbsp; At last he yielded, told me of a plot, a capital
one, and set to work upon it.&nbsp; When it was finished he sent
the manuscript to me, and I read it through with the greatest
interest, and also the greatest care.&nbsp; I found, as I
expected to find, that the gipsy chapters were simply perfect,
and that it was altogether an extremely clever romance; but I
felt also that Groome had given no attention whatever to the
structure of a story.&nbsp; Incidents of the most striking and
original kind were introduced at the wrong places, and this made
them interesting no <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>longer.&nbsp; So persuaded was I
that the story only needed recasting to prove a real success that
I devoted days, and even weeks, to going through the novel, and
indicating where the transpositions should take place.&nbsp;
Groome, however, had got so entirely sick of his novel before he
had completed it that he refused absolutely to put another
hour&rsquo;s work into it; for, as he said, &ldquo;the writing of
it had already been a loss to the pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent it, as it was, to an eminent firm of publishers, who,
knowing Groome and his abilities, would have willingly taken it
if they had seen their way to do so.&nbsp; But they could not,
for the very reasons that had induced me to recast it, and they
declined it.&nbsp; The book was then sent round to publisher
after publisher with the same result; and yet there was more fine
substance in this novel than in five ordinary stories.&nbsp; It
was at last through the good offices of Mr. Coulson Kernahan that
it was eventually taken by Messrs. Ward &amp; Lock; and, although
it won warm eulogies from such great writers as George Meredith,
it never made its way.&nbsp; Its failure distressed me far more
than it distressed Groome, for I loved the man, and knew what its
success would have been to him.&nbsp; Amiable and charming as
Groome was, there was in him a singular vein of dogged obstinacy
after he had formed an opinion; and he not only refused to recast
his story, but <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>refused to abandon the absurd name
of &lsquo;Kriegspiel&rsquo; for a volume of romantic gipsy
adventure.&nbsp; I suspect that a large proportion of people who
asked for &lsquo;Kriegspiel&rsquo; at Mudie&rsquo;s and
Smith&rsquo;s consisted of officers who thought that it was a
book on the German war game.</p>
<p>I tried to persuade him to begin another gipsy novel, but
found it quite impossible to do so.&nbsp; But even then I waited
before bringing out my own prose story.&nbsp; I published instead
my poem in which was told the story of Rhona Boswell, which, to
my own surprise and Groome&rsquo;s, had a success,
notwithstanding its gipsy subject.&nbsp; Then I brought out my
gipsy story, and accepted its success rather ungratefully,
remembering how the greatest gipsy scholar in the world had
failed in this line.&nbsp; In 1899 he published &lsquo;Gypsy
Folk-Tales,&rsquo; in which he got the aid of the first Romany
scholar now living, Mr. John Sampson.&nbsp; And this was followed
in 1901 by his edition of &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; which,
notwithstanding certain unnecessary carpings at
Borrow&mdash;such, for instance, as the assertion that the word
&ldquo;dook&rdquo; is never used in Anglo-Romany for
&ldquo;ghost&rdquo;&mdash;is beyond any doubt the best edition of
the book ever published.&nbsp; The introduction gives sketches of
all the Romany Ryes and students of Romany, from Andrew Boorde
(<i>c.</i> 1490&ndash;1549) down to Mr. G. R. Sims and Mr. David
MacRitchie.&nbsp; During this time it <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>was
becoming painfully perceptible to me that his physical powers
were waning, although for two years that decadence seemed to have
no effect upon his mental powers.&nbsp; But at last, while he was
working on a book in which he took the deepest interest&mdash;the
new edition of &lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia of
English Literature&rsquo;&mdash;it became manifest that the
general physical depression was sapping the forces of the
brain.</p>
<p>But it is personal reminiscences of Groome that I have been
invited to write, and I have not yet even begun upon these.&nbsp;
Our close friendship dated no further back than 1881&mdash;the
year in which died the great Romany Rye.&nbsp; Indeed, it was
owing to Borrow&rsquo;s death, coupled with Groome&rsquo;s
interest in that same Romany girl Sinfi Lovell, whom the eloquent
Romany preacher &ldquo;Gipsy Smith&rdquo; has lately been
expiating upon to immense audiences, that I first became
acquainted with Groome.&nbsp; Although he has himself in some
magazine told the story, it seems necessary for me to retell it
here, for I know of no better way of giving the readers of <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i> a picture of Frank Groome as he lives in my
mind.</p>
<p>It was in 1881 that Borrow, who some seven years before went
down to Oulton, as he told me, &ldquo;to die,&rdquo; achieved
death.&nbsp; And it devolved upon me as the chief friend of his
latest years to write an obituary notice of him in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; Among the many interesting letters <!--
page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>that it brought me from strangers was one from Groome,
whose name was familiar to me as the author of the article
&lsquo;Gypsies&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica.&rsquo;&nbsp; But besides this I had read &lsquo;In
Gypsy Tents,&rsquo; a picture of the very kind of gipsies I knew
myself, those of East Anglia&mdash;a picture whose photographic
truth had quite startled me.&nbsp; Howsoever much of matter of
fact may be worked into &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; (and to no one did
Borrow talk with so little reticence upon this delicate subject
as to me during many a stroll about Wimbledon Common and Richmond
Park), I am certain that his first-hand knowledge of gipsy life
was quite superficial compared with Groome&rsquo;s during the
nine years or so that he was brought into contact with them in
Great Britain and on the Continent.&nbsp; Hence a book like
&lsquo;In Gypsy Tents&rsquo; has for a student of Romany subjects
an interest altogether different from that which Borrow&rsquo;s
books command; for while Borrow, the man of genius, throws by the
very necessities of his temperament the colours of romance around
his gipsies, the characters of &lsquo;In Gypsy Tents,&rsquo;
depicted by a man of remarkable talent merely, are as realistic
as though painted by Zola, while the wealth of gipsy lore at his
command is simply overwhelming.</p>
<p>At that time&mdash;with the exception of Borrow and the late
Sir Richard Burton&mdash;the only man of letters with whom I had
been <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>brought into contact who knew
anything about the gipsies was Tom Taylor, whose picture of
Romany life in an anonymous story called &lsquo;Gypsy
Experiences,&rsquo; which appeared in <i>The Illustrated London
News</i> in 1851, and in his play &lsquo;Sir Roger de
Coverley,&rsquo; is not only fascinating, but on the whole
true.&nbsp; By-the-by, this charming play might be revived now
that there is a revived interest in Romany matters.&nbsp; George
Meredith&rsquo;s wonderful &lsquo;Kiomi&rsquo; was a picture, I
think, of the only Romany chi he knew; but genius such as his
needs little straw for the making of bricks.&nbsp; The letter I
received from Groome enclosed a ragged and well-worn cutting from
a forgotten anonymous <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> article of mine,
written as far back as 1877, in which I showed acquaintance with
gipsydom and described the ascent of Snowdon in the company of
Sinfi Lovell, which was afterwards removed bodily to
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here is the cutting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We had a striking instance of this some
years ago, when crossing Snowdon from Capel Curig, one morning,
with a friend.&nbsp; She was not what is technically called a
lady, yet she was both tall and, in her way, handsome, and was
far more clever than many of those who might look down upon her;
for her speculative and her practical abilities were equally
remarkable: besides being the first palmist of her time, she had
the reputation of being able to make more clothes-pegs in an
hour, and sell <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>more, than any other woman in
England.&nbsp; The splendour of that &lsquo;Snowdon
sunrise&rsquo; was such as we can say, from much experience, can
only be seen about once in a lifetime, and could never be given
by any pen or pencil.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to enjoy
it a bit,&rsquo; was the irritated remark we could not help
making to our friend, who stood quite silent and apparently deaf
to the rhapsodies in which we had been indulging, as we both
stood looking at the peaks, or rather at the vast masses of
billowy vapours enveloping them, as they sometimes boiled and
sometimes blazed, shaking, whenever the sun struck one and then
another, from amethyst to vermilion, &lsquo;shot&rsquo; now and
then with gold.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t injiy it, don&rsquo;t
I?&rsquo; said she, removing her pipe.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>You</i>
injiy talking about it, <i>I</i> injiy lettin&rsquo; it soak
in.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Groome asked whether the gipsy mentioned in the cutting was
not a certain Romany chi whom he named, and said that he had
always wondered who the writer of that article was, and that now
he wondered no longer, for he knew him to be the writer of the
obituary notice of George Borrow.&nbsp; Interested as I was in
his letter, it came at a moment when the illness of a very dear
friend of mine threw most other things out of my mind, and it was
a good while before I answered it, and told him what I had to
tell about my Welsh gipsy experiences and the adventure on
Snowdon.&nbsp; I got another letter from him, and this was the
beginning of a charming correspondence.&nbsp; After a while <!--
page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>I discovered that there were, besides Romany matters,
other points of attraction between us.&nbsp; Groome was the son
of Edward FitzGerald&rsquo;s intimate friend Robert Hindes
Groome, Archdeacon of Suffolk.&nbsp; Now long before the great
vogue of Omar Khayyam, and, of course, long before the
institution of the Omar Khayyam Club, there was a little group of
Omarians of which I was a member.&nbsp; I need not say here who
were the others of that group, but it was to them I alluded in
the &lsquo;Toast to Omar Khayyam,&rsquo; which years afterwards I
printed in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, and have since reprinted in
a volume of mine.</p>
<p>After a while it was arranged that he was to come and visit us
for a few days at The Pines.&nbsp; When it got wind in the little
household here that another Romany Rye, a successor to George
Borrow, was to visit us, and when it further became known that he
had travelled with Hungarian gipsies, Roumanian gipsies,
Roumelian gipsies, &amp;c., I don&rsquo;t know what kind of wild
and dishevelled visitor was not expected.&nbsp; Instead of such a
guest there appeared one of the neatest and most quiet young
gentlemen who had ever presented themselves at the door.&nbsp; No
one could possibly have dared to associate Bohemia with
him.&nbsp; As a friend remarked who was afterwards invited to
meet him at luncheon, &ldquo;Clergyman&rsquo;s son&mdash;suckling
for the Church, was stamped upon him from head to
foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>I will not deny that so respectable
a looking Romany Rye rather disappointed The Pines at
first.&nbsp; At that time he was a little over thirty, but owing
to his slender, graceful figure, and especially owing to his
lithe movements and elastic walk, he seemed to be several years
younger.</p>
<p>The subject of Welsh gipsies, and especially of the Romany chi
of Swindon, made us intimate friends in half an hour, and then
there were East Anglia, Omar Khayy&agrave;m, and Edward
FitzGerald to talk about!&mdash;a delightful new friend for a man
who had so lately lost the only other Romany Rye in the
world.&nbsp; Owing to his youthful appearance, I christened him
there and then the &ldquo;Tarno Rye,&rdquo; in remembrance of
that other &ldquo;Tarno Rye&rdquo; whom Rhona Boswell
loved.&nbsp; I soon found that, great as was the physical
contrast between the Tarno Rye and the original Romany Rye, the
mental contrast was greater still.&nbsp; Both were shy&mdash;very
shy; but while Borrow&rsquo;s shyness seemed to be born of
wariness, the wariness of a man who felt that he was famous and
had a part to play before an inquisitive world, Groome&rsquo;s
shyness arose from a modesty that was unique.</p>
<p>As a philologist merely, to speak of nothing else, his
equipment was ten times that of Borrow, whose temperament may be
called anti-academic, and who really knew nothing
thoroughly.&nbsp; But while Borrow was for ever <!-- page
291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>displaying his philology, and seemed always far prouder
of it than of his fascinating powers as a writer of romantic
adventures, Groome&rsquo;s philological stores, like all his
other intellectual riches, had to be drawn from him by his
interlocutor if they were to be recognized at all.&nbsp; Whenever
Borrow enunciated anything showing, as he thought, exceptional
philological knowledge or exceptional acquaintance with matters
Romany, it was his way always to bring it out with a sort of
rustic twinkle of conscious superiority, which in its way,
however, was very engaging.&nbsp; From Groome, on the contrary,
philological lore would drop, when it did come, as unconsciously
as drops of rain that fall.&nbsp; It was the same with his
knowledge of Romany matters, which was so vast.&nbsp; Not once in
all my close intercourse with him did he display his knowledge of
this subject save in answer to some inquiry.&nbsp; The same thing
is to be noticed in &lsquo;Kriegspiel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Romany
students alone are able by reading between the lines to discover
how deep is the hidden knowledge of Romany matters, so full is
the story of allusions which are lost upon the general
reader&mdash;lost, indeed, upon all readers except the very
few.&nbsp; For instance, the gipsy villain of the story, Perun,
when telling the tale of his crime against the father of the hero
who married the Romany chi whom Perun had hoped to marry, makes
allusion thus to the dead woman: <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>&ldquo;And
then about her as I have named too often to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had
Borrow been alluding to the Romany taboo of the names of the
dead, how differently would he have gone to work! how eager would
he have been to display and explain his knowledge of this
remarkable Romany superstition!&nbsp; The same remark may be made
upon the gipsy heroine&rsquo;s sly allusion in
&lsquo;Kriegspiel&rsquo; to &ldquo;Squire Lucas,&rdquo; the
Romany equivalent of Baron Munchausen, an allusion which none but
a Romany student would understand.</p>
<p>Before luncheon Groome and I took a walk over the common, and
along the Portsmouth Road, through the Robin Hood Gate and across
Richmond Park, where Borrow and I and Dr. Hake had so often
strolled.&nbsp; I wondered what the Gryengroes whom Borrow used
to foregather with would have thought of my new friend.&nbsp; In
personal appearance the two Romany Ryes were as unlike as in
every point of character they were unlike.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
giant frame made him stand conspicuous wherever he went,
Groome&rsquo;s slender, slight body gave an impression of great
agility; and the walk of the two great pedestrians was equally
contrasted.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s slope over the ground with the
loose, long step of a hound I have, on a previous occasion,
described; Groome&rsquo;s walk was springy as a gipsy
lad&rsquo;s, and as noiseless as a cat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Of course, the talk during that walk ran very <!-- page
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>much upon Borrow, whom Groome had seen once or twice,
but whom he did not in the least understand.&nbsp; The two men
were antipathetic to each other.&nbsp; It was then that he told
me how he had first been thrown across the gipsies, and it was
then that he began to open up to me his wonderful record of
experiences among them.&nbsp; The talk during that first out of
many most delightful strolls ran upon Benfey, and afterwards upon
all kinds of Romany matters.&nbsp; I remember how warm he waxed
upon his pet aversion, &ldquo;Smith of Coalville,&rdquo; as he
called him, who, he said, for the purposes of a professional
philanthropist, had done infinite mischief to the gipsies by
confounding them with all the wandering cockney raff from the
slums of London.&nbsp; On my repeating to him what, among other
things, the Romany chi before mentioned said to me during the
ascent of Snowdon from Capel Curig, that &ldquo;to make
<i>kairengroes</i> (house-dwellers) of full-blooded Romanies was
impossible, because they were the cuckoos of the human race, who
had no desire to build nests, and were pricked on to move about
from one place to another over the earth,&rdquo; Groome&rsquo;s
tongue became loosened, and he launched out into a monologue on
this subject full of learning and full, as it seemed to me, of
original views upon the Romanies.</p>
<p>As an instance of the cuckoo instincts of the true Romany, he
told me that in North America&mdash;<!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>for which
land, alas! so many of our best Romanies even in Borrow&rsquo;s
time were leaving Gypsey Dell and the grassy lanes of old
England&mdash;the gipsies have contracted a habit, which is
growing rather than waning, of migrating southward in autumn and
northward again in spring.&nbsp; He then launched out upon the
subject of the wide dispersion of the Romanies not only in
Europe&mdash;where they are found from almost the extreme north
to the extreme south, and from the shores of the Bosphorus to the
shores of the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;but also from north to south
and from east to west in Asia, in Africa, from Egypt to the very
south of the Soudan, and in America from Canada to the River
Amazon.&nbsp; And he then went on to show how intensely migratory
they were over all these vast areas.</p>
<p>So absorbing had been the gipsy talk that I am afraid the
waiting luncheon was spoilt.&nbsp; The little luncheon party was
composed of fervent admirers of Sir Walter Scott&mdash;bigoted
admirers, I fear, some of our present-day critics would have
dubbed us; and it chanced that we all agreed in pronouncing
&lsquo;Guy Mannering&rsquo; to be the most fascinating of all the
Wizard&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Of course Meg Merrilies became at once
the centre of the talk.&nbsp; One contended that, great as Meg
was as a woman, she was as a gipsy a failure; in short, that
Scott&rsquo;s idea of the Scottish gipsy woman was
conventional&mdash;<!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>a fancy portrait in which are
depicted some of the loftiest characteristics of the Highland
woman rather than of the Scottish gipsy.&nbsp; The true romany
chi can be quite as noble as Meg Merrilies, said one, but great
in a different way.&nbsp; From Meg Merrilies the talk naturally
turned upon Jane Gordon of Kirk Yetholm, Meg&rsquo;s prototype,
who, when an old woman, was ducked to death in the River Eden at
Carlisle.&nbsp; Then came the subject of Kirk Yetholm itself, the
famous headquarters of the Scotch Romanies; and after this it
naturally turned to Kirk Yetholm&rsquo;s most famous inhabitant,
old Will Faas, the gipsy king, whose corpse was escorted to
Yetholm by three hundred and more donkeys.&nbsp; And upon all
these subjects Groome&rsquo;s knowledge was like an inexhaustible
fountain; or rather it was like a tap, ready to supply any amount
of lore when called upon to do so.</p>
<p>But it was not merely upon Romany subjects that Groome found
points of sympathy at The Pines during that first luncheon; there
was that other subject before mentioned, Edward FitzGerald and
Omar Khayy&agrave;m.&nbsp; We, a handful of Omarians of those
antediluvian days, were perhaps all the more intense in our cult
because we believed it to be esoteric.&nbsp; And here was a guest
who had been brought into actual personal contact with the
wonderful old Fitz.&nbsp; As a child of eight he had seen
him&mdash;talked with him&mdash;<!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>been patted
on the head by him.&nbsp; Groome&rsquo;s father, the Archdeacon
of Suffolk, was one of FitzGerald&rsquo;s most intimate
friends.&nbsp; This was at once a delightful and a powerful link
between Frank Groome and those at the luncheon table; and when he
heard, as he soon did, the toast to &ldquo;Omar
Khayy&agrave;m,&rdquo; none drank that toast with more gusto than
he.&nbsp; The fact is, as the Romanies say, that true friendship,
like true love, is apt to begin at first sight.&nbsp; But I must
stop.&nbsp; Frequently when the &ldquo;Tarno Rye&rdquo; came to
England his headquarters were at The Pines.&nbsp; Many and
delightful were the strolls he and I had together.&nbsp; One day
we went to hear a gipsy band supposed to be composed of Roumelian
gipsies.&nbsp; After we had listened to several well-executed
things Groome sauntered up to one of the performers and spoke to
him in Roumelian Romany.&nbsp; The man, although he did not
understand Groome, knew that he was speaking Romany of some kind,
and began speaking in Hungarian Romany, and was at once responded
to by Groome in that variety of the Romany tongue.&nbsp; Groome
then turned to another of the performers, and was answered in
English Romany.&nbsp; At last he found one, and one only, in the
band who was a Roumelian gipsy, and a conversation between them
at once began.</p>
<p>This incident affords an illustration of the width as well as
the thoroughness of Groome&rsquo;s <!-- page 297--><a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>knowledge
of Romany matters.&nbsp; I have affirmed in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
that Sinfi Lovell&mdash;a born linguist who could neither read
nor write&mdash;was the only gipsy who knew both English and
Welsh Romany.&nbsp; Groome was one of the few Englishmen who knew
the most interesting of all varieties of the Romany tongue.&nbsp;
But latterly he talked a great deal of the vast knowledge of the
Welsh gipsies, both as to language and folklore, possessed by Mr.
John Sampson, University Librarian at Liverpool, the scholar who
did so much to aid Groome in his last volume on Romany subjects,
called &lsquo;Gypsy Folk-Tales.&rsquo;&nbsp; It therefore gives
me the greatest pleasure to end these very inadequate words of
mine with a beautiful little poem in Welsh Romany by Mr. Sampson
upon the death of the &ldquo;Tarno Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a very
few years Welsh Romany will become absolutely extinct, and then
this little gem, so full of the Romany feeling, will be greatly
prized.&nbsp; I wish I could have written the poem myself, but no
man could have written it save Mr. Sampson:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although novelists, dramatists, and poets are particularly
fond of trying to paint the gipsies, it cannot be said that many
of them have been successful in their delineations.&nbsp; And
this is because the inner and the outer life of a proscribed race
must necessarily be unlike each other.&nbsp; Meg Merrilies is no
more a gipsy than is Borrow&rsquo;s delightful Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; Among the characteristic traits of the Romany
woman, Meg does no doubt exhibit two: a wild poetic imagination
and a fearlessness such as women rarely display.&nbsp; But no one
who had been brought into personal contact with gipsy women could
ever have presented Meg Merrilies as one of them.&nbsp; In the
true Romany chi poetic imagination is combined with a homeliness
and a positive love of respectability which are very
curious.&nbsp; Not that Meg, noble as she is, is superior to the
kind of heroic woman that the Romany race is capable of
producing.&nbsp; Indeed, the great speciality of the Romanies is
the superiority of the women to the men&mdash;a superiority which
extends to everything, unless, perhaps, we except that gift of
music for which the gipsies are noticeable.&nbsp; Even in Eastern
<!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>Europe&mdash;Russia alone excepted&mdash;where gipsy
music is so universal that, according to some writers, every
Hungarian musician is of Romany extraction, it is the men and
not, in general, the women who excel.&nbsp; This, however, may
simply be the result of opportunity and training.</p>
<p>It is not merely in intelligence, in imagination, in command
over language, in breadth of view regarding the
&ldquo;Gorgio&rdquo; world around them, that the Romany women, in
Great Britain at least, leave the men far behind.&nbsp; In
character this superiority is equally noticeable.&nbsp; To
imagine a gipsy hero is not easy.&nbsp; The male gipsy is not
without a certain amount of courage, but it soon gives way, and
in a physical conflict between a gipsy and an Englishman it
always seems as though ages of oppression have damped its
virility.&nbsp; Although some of our most notable prizefighters
have been gipsies, it used to be well known in times when the
ring was fashionable that a gipsy could not be relied upon
&ldquo;to take punishment&rdquo; with the stolid indifference of
an Englishman or a negro, partly, perhaps, because his more
highly strung nervous system makes him more sensitive to
pain.&nbsp; The courage of a gipsy woman, on the other hand, has
passed into a proverb; nothing seems to daunt her, and yet she
will allow her husband, a cowardly ruffian himself, perhaps, to
strike her without returning the blow.&nbsp; Wife-beating,
however, is not common among the gipsies.&nbsp; It may possibly
<!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>be the case that some of the fine qualities of the
gipsy woman are the result of that very barrenness of fine
qualities among the men of which we have been speaking.&nbsp; The
lack of masculine chivalry among the men may in some measure
account for the irresistible impulse among the women for taking
their own part without appealing to the men for aid.&nbsp; Also
this may account for the strong way in which a gipsy woman is
often drawn to the &ldquo;Tarno Rye,&rdquo; the young English
gentleman of whom Matthew Arnold was thinking when he wrote the
&lsquo;Scholar-Gipsy,&rsquo; and her fidelity to whom is so
striking.&nbsp; It is often in such relations as these with the
Tarno Rye that the instinct of monogamy in the Romany woman is
seen.&nbsp; The unconquerable virtue of the Romany chi was often
commented upon by Borrow; and, indeed, every observer of gipsy
life is struck by it.</p>
<p>Seeing that the moment the Romanies are brought into contact
with the Gorgio world they adopt a method of approach entirely
different from the natural method&mdash;natural to them in
intercourse with each other&mdash;it is perhaps no wonder that
the popular notion of the gipsy girl, taken mainly from the
tradition of the stage, is so fantastically wrong.&nbsp; With
regard to the stage, no characters in the least like gipsies ever
appeared on the boards, save the characters in Tom Taylor&rsquo;s
<!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>&lsquo;Sir Roger de Coverley.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the eyes
of the novelist, as well as in the eyes of the playwright,
devilry seems to be the chief characteristic of the gipsy
woman.&nbsp; The fact is, however, that in the average gipsy
woman as she really exists there is but little devilry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Romany guile,&rdquo; which is well defined in the gipsy
phrase as &ldquo;the lie for the Gorgios,&rdquo; does not prevent
gipsy women from retaining some of the most marked
characteristics of childhood throughout their lives.&nbsp; This,
indeed, is one of their special charms.&nbsp; In his desire to
depict the supposed devilry of the Romany woman, Prosper
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e has perpetrated in &lsquo;Carmen&rsquo; the
greatest of all caricatures of the gipsy girl.&nbsp; A mere
incarnation of lust and bloodthirstiness is more likely to exist
in any other race than in the Romanies, who have a great deal of
love as a sentiment and comparatively very little of love as a
movement of animal desire.</p>
<p>In G. P. R. James&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gipsy&rsquo; (1835) there are
touches which certainly show some original knowledge of Romany
life and character.&nbsp; The same may, perhaps, be said of
Sheridan Le Fanu&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bird of Passage,&rsquo; but the
pictures of gipsy life in these and in all other novels are the
merest daubs compared with the Kiomi of George Meredith&rsquo;s
story &lsquo;Harry Richmond.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not even Borrow and
Groome, with all their intimate knowledge of gipsy life, ever
painted a more vigorous picture of the Romany chi <!-- page
303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>than this.&nbsp; The original was well known in the art
circles of London at one time, and was probably known to
Meredith, but this does not in any way derogate from the
splendour of the imaginative achievement of painting in a few
touches a Romany girl who must, one would think, live for
ever.</p>
<p>Between some Englishmen and gipsy women there is an
extraordinary attraction&mdash;an attraction, we may say in
passing, which did not exist between Borrow and the gipsy women
with whom he was brought into contact.&nbsp; Supposing Borrow to
have been physically drawn to any woman, she would have been of
the Scandinavian type; she would have been what he used to call a
Brynhild.&nbsp; It was tall blondes he really admired.&nbsp;
Hence, notwithstanding his love of the economies of gipsy life,
his gipsy women are all mere &ldquo;scenic
characters&rdquo;&mdash;they clothe and beautify the scene; they
are not dramatic characters.&nbsp; When he comes to delineate a
heroine, Isopel Berners, she is physically the very opposite of
the Romany chi&mdash;a Scandinavian Brynhild, in short.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
